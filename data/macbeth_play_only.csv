First Witch,1,1,1,When shall we three meet again?
First Witch,1,1,2,"In thunder, lightning, or in rain?"
Second Witch,1,1,3,"When the hurly-burly’s done,"
Second Witch,1,1,4,When the battle’s lost and won.
Third Witch,1,1,5,That will be ere the set of sun.
First Witch,1,1,6,Where the place?
Second Witch,1,1,7,Upon the heath.
Third Witch,1,1,8,There to meet with Macbeth.
First Witch,1,1,9,"I come, Graymalkin."
Second Witch,1,1,10,Paddock calls.
Third Witch,1,1,11,Anon.
Second Witch,1,1,12,"Fair is foul, and foul is fair;"
First Witch,1,1,13,Hover through the fog and filthy air.
Duncan,1,2,14,"What bloody man is that? He can report,"
Duncan,1,2,15,"As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt"
Duncan,1,2,16,The newest state.
Malcolm,1,2,17,This is the sergeant
Malcolm,1,2,18,"Who, like a good and hardy soldier, fought"
Malcolm,1,2,19,"’Gainst my captivity.—Hail, brave friend!"
Malcolm,1,2,20,Say to the King the knowledge of the broil
Malcolm,1,2,21,As thou didst leave it.
Captain,1,2,22,"Doubtful it stood,"
Captain,1,2,23,As two spent swimmers that do cling together
Captain,1,2,24,And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald
Captain,1,2,25,"(Worthy to be a rebel, for to that"
Captain,1,2,26,The multiplying villainies of nature
Captain,1,2,27,Do swarm upon him) from the Western Isles
Captain,1,2,28,Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
Captain,1,2,29,"And Fortune, on his damnèd quarrel smiling,"
Captain,1,2,30,Showed like a rebel’s whore. But all’s too weak;
Captain,1,2,31,"For brave Macbeth (well he deserves that name),"
Captain,1,2,32,"Disdaining Fortune, with his brandished steel,"
Captain,1,2,33,"Which smoked with bloody execution,"
Captain,1,2,34,"Like Valor’s minion, carved out his passage"
Captain,1,2,35,Till he faced the slave;
Captain,1,2,36,"Which ne’er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,"
Captain,1,2,37,"Till he unseamed him from the nave to th’ chops,"
Captain,1,2,38,And fixed his head upon our battlements.
Duncan,1,2,39,"O valiant cousin, worthy gentleman!"
Captain,1,2,40,As whence the sun ’gins his reflection
Captain,1,2,41,"Shipwracking storms and direful thunders break,"
Captain,1,2,42,So from that spring whence comfort seemed to
Captain,1,2,43,come
Captain,1,2,44,"Discomfort swells. Mark, King of Scotland, mark:"
Captain,1,2,45,"No sooner justice had, with valor armed,"
Captain,1,2,46,"Compelled these skipping kerns to trust their heels,"
Captain,1,2,47,"But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,"
Captain,1,2,48,"With furbished arms and new supplies of men,"
Captain,1,2,49,Began a fresh assault.
Duncan,1,2,50,"Dismayed not this our captains, Macbeth and"
Duncan,1,2,51,Banquo?
Captain,1,2,52,"Yes, as sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion."
Captain,1,2,53,"If I say sooth, I must report they were"
Captain,1,2,54,"As cannons overcharged with double cracks,"
Captain,1,2,55,So they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe.
Captain,1,2,56,Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds
Captain,1,2,57,"Or memorize another Golgotha,"
Captain,1,2,58,I cannot tell—
Captain,1,2,59,But I am faint. My gashes cry for help.
Duncan,1,2,60,So well thy words become thee as thy wounds:
Duncan,1,2,61,"They smack of honor both.—Go, get him surgeons."
Duncan,1,2,62,Who comes here?
Malcolm,1,2,63,The worthy Thane of Ross.
Lennox,1,2,64,What a haste looks through his eyes!
Lennox,1,2,65,So should he look that seems to speak things
Lennox,1,2,66,strange.
Ross,1,2,67,God save the King.
Duncan,1,2,68,"Whence cam’st thou, worthy thane?"
Ross,1,2,69,"From Fife, great king,"
Ross,1,2,70,Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
Ross,1,2,71,And fan our people cold.
Ross,1,2,72,"Norway himself, with terrible numbers,"
Ross,1,2,73,"Assisted by that most disloyal traitor,"
Ross,1,2,74,"The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict,"
Ross,1,2,75,"Till that Bellona’s bridegroom, lapped in proof,"
Ross,1,2,76,"Confronted him with self-comparisons,"
Ross,1,2,77,"Point against point, rebellious arm ’gainst arm,"
Ross,1,2,78,"Curbing his lavish spirit. And to conclude,"
Ross,1,2,79,The victory fell on us.
Duncan,1,2,80,Great happiness!
Ross,1,2,81,"That now Sweno,"
Ross,1,2,82,"The Norways’ king, craves composition."
Ross,1,2,83,Nor would we deign him burial of his men
Ross,1,2,84,Till he disbursèd at Saint Colme’s Inch
Ross,1,2,85,Ten thousand dollars to our general use.
Duncan,1,2,86,No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive
Duncan,1,2,87,"Our bosom interest. Go, pronounce his present"
Duncan,1,2,88,"death,"
Duncan,1,2,89,And with his former title greet Macbeth.
Ross,1,2,90,I’ll see it done.
Duncan,1,2,91,"What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won."
First Witch,1,3,92,"Where hast thou been, sister?"
Second Witch,1,3,93,Killing swine.
Third Witch,1,3,94,"Sister, where thou?"
First Witch,1,3,95,A sailor’s wife had chestnuts in her lap
First Witch,1,3,96,And munched and munched and munched. Give
First Witch,1,3,97,"me, quoth I."
First Witch,1,3,98,"Aroint thee, witch, the rump-fed runnion cries."
First Witch,1,3,99,"Her husband’s to Aleppo gone, master o’ th’ Tiger;"
First Witch,1,3,100,"But in a sieve I’ll thither sail,"
First Witch,1,3,101,"And, like a rat without a tail,"
First Witch,1,3,102,"I’ll do, I’ll do, and I’ll do."
Second Witch,1,3,103,I’ll give thee a wind.
First Witch,1,3,104,Th’ art kind.
Third Witch,1,3,105,And I another.
First Witch,1,3,106,"I myself have all the other,"
First Witch,1,3,107,And the very ports they blow;
First Witch,1,3,108,All the quarters that they know
First Witch,1,3,109,I’ th’ shipman’s card.
First Witch,1,3,110,I’ll drain him dry as hay.
First Witch,1,3,111,Sleep shall neither night nor day
First Witch,1,3,112,Hang upon his penthouse lid.
First Witch,1,3,113,He shall live a man forbid.
First Witch,1,3,114,"Weary sev’nnights, nine times nine,"
First Witch,1,3,115,"Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine."
First Witch,1,3,116,"Though his bark cannot be lost,"
First Witch,1,3,117,Yet it shall be tempest-tossed.
First Witch,1,3,118,Look what I have.
Second Witch,1,3,119,"Show me, show me."
First Witch,1,3,120,"Here I have a pilot’s thumb,"
First Witch,1,3,121,Wracked as homeward he did come.
Third Witch,1,3,122,"A drum, a drum!"
Third Witch,1,3,123,Macbeth doth come.
First Witch,1,3,124,"The Weïrd Sisters, hand in hand,"
Third Witch,1,3,125,"Posters of the sea and land,"
First Witch,1,3,126,"Thus do go about, about,"
Third Witch,1,3,127,Thrice to thine and thrice to mine
Second Witch,1,3,128,"And thrice again, to make up nine."
Third Witch,1,3,129,"Peace, the charm’s wound up."
Macbeth,1,3,130,So foul and fair a day I have not seen.
Banquo,1,3,131,"How far is ’t called to Forres?—What are these,"
Banquo,1,3,132,"So withered, and so wild in their attire,"
Banquo,1,3,133,That look not like th’ inhabitants o’ th’ Earth
Banquo,1,3,134,And yet are on ’t?—Live you? Or are you aught
Banquo,1,3,135,That man may question? You seem to understand
Banquo,1,3,136,me
Banquo,1,3,137,By each at once her choppy finger laying
Banquo,1,3,138,"Upon her skinny lips. You should be women,"
Banquo,1,3,139,And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
Banquo,1,3,140,That you are so.
Macbeth,1,3,141,Speak if you can. What are you?
First Witch,1,3,142,"All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!"
Second Witch,1,3,143,"All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!"
Third Witch,1,3,144,"All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be king hereafter!"
Banquo,1,3,145,"Good sir, why do you start and seem to fear"
Banquo,1,3,146,"Things that do sound so fair?—I’ th’ name of truth,"
Banquo,1,3,147,"Are you fantastical, or that indeed"
Banquo,1,3,148,Which outwardly you show? My noble partner
Banquo,1,3,149,You greet with present grace and great prediction
Banquo,1,3,150,"Of noble having and of royal hope,"
Banquo,1,3,151,That he seems rapt withal. To me you speak not.
Banquo,1,3,152,If you can look into the seeds of time
Banquo,1,3,153,"And say which grain will grow and which will not,"
Banquo,1,3,154,"Speak, then, to me, who neither beg nor fear"
Banquo,1,3,155,Your favors nor your hate.
Second Witch,1,3,156,Hail!
First Witch,1,3,157,Hail!
Second Witch,1,3,158,Hail!
First Witch,1,3,159,Lesser than Macbeth and greater.
Second Witch,1,3,160,"Not so happy, yet much happier."
Third Witch,1,3,161,"Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none."
Third Witch,1,3,162,"So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!"
First Witch,1,3,163,"Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!"
Macbeth,1,3,164,"Stay, you imperfect speakers. Tell me more."
Macbeth,1,3,165,By Sinel’s death I know I am Thane of Glamis.
Macbeth,1,3,166,But how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives
Macbeth,1,3,167,"A prosperous gentleman, and to be king"
Macbeth,1,3,168,"Stands not within the prospect of belief,"
Macbeth,1,3,169,No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
Macbeth,1,3,170,You owe this strange intelligence or why
Macbeth,1,3,171,Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
Macbeth,1,3,172,"With such prophetic greeting. Speak, I charge you."
Banquo,1,3,173,"The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,"
Banquo,1,3,174,And these are of them. Whither are they vanished?
Macbeth,1,3,175,"Into the air, and what seemed corporal melted,"
Macbeth,1,3,176,As breath into the wind. Would they had stayed!
Banquo,1,3,177,Were such things here as we do speak about?
Banquo,1,3,178,Or have we eaten on the insane root
Banquo,1,3,179,That takes the reason prisoner?
Macbeth,1,3,180,Your children shall be kings.
Banquo,1,3,181,You shall be king.
Macbeth,1,3,182,And Thane of Cawdor too. Went it not so?
Banquo,1,3,183,To th’ selfsame tune and words.—Who’s here?
Ross,1,3,184,"The King hath happily received, Macbeth,"
Ross,1,3,185,"The news of thy success, and, when he reads"
Ross,1,3,186,"Thy personal venture in the rebels’ fight,"
Ross,1,3,187,His wonders and his praises do contend
Ross,1,3,188,"Which should be thine or his. Silenced with that,"
Ross,1,3,189,In viewing o’er the rest o’ th’ selfsame day
Ross,1,3,190,"He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,"
Ross,1,3,191,"Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,"
Ross,1,3,192,Strange images of death. As thick as tale
Ross,1,3,193,"Came post with post, and every one did bear"
Ross,1,3,194,"Thy praises in his kingdom’s great defense,"
Ross,1,3,195,And poured them down before him.
Angus,1,3,196,We are sent
Angus,1,3,197,"To give thee from our royal master thanks,"
Angus,1,3,198,"Only to herald thee into his sight,"
Angus,1,3,199,Not pay thee.
Ross,1,3,200,"And for an earnest of a greater honor,"
Ross,1,3,201,"He bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor,"
Ross,1,3,202,"In which addition, hail, most worthy thane,"
Ross,1,3,203,For it is thine.
Banquo,1,3,204,"What, can the devil speak true?"
Macbeth,1,3,205,The Thane of Cawdor lives. Why do you dress me
Macbeth,1,3,206,In borrowed robes?
Angus,1,3,207,"Who was the Thane lives yet,"
Angus,1,3,208,But under heavy judgment bears that life
Angus,1,3,209,Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was
Angus,1,3,210,combined
Angus,1,3,211,"With those of Norway, or did line the rebel"
Angus,1,3,212,"With hidden help and vantage, or that with both"
Angus,1,3,213,"He labored in his country’s wrack, I know not;"
Angus,1,3,214,"But treasons capital, confessed and proved,"
Angus,1,3,215,Have overthrown him.
Macbeth,1,3,216,Glamis and Thane of Cawdor!
Macbeth,1,3,217,The greatest is behind. Thanks
Macbeth,1,3,218,for your pains.
Macbeth,1,3,219,Do you not hope your children
Macbeth,1,3,220,"shall be kings,"
Macbeth,1,3,221,When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me
Macbeth,1,3,222,Promised no less to them?
Banquo,1,3,223,"That, trusted home,"
Banquo,1,3,224,"Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,"
Banquo,1,3,225,Besides the Thane of Cawdor. But ’tis strange.
Banquo,1,3,226,"And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,"
Banquo,1,3,227,"The instruments of darkness tell us truths,"
Banquo,1,3,228,"Win us with honest trifles, to betray ’s"
Banquo,1,3,229,In deepest consequence.—
Banquo,1,3,230,"Cousins, a word, I pray you."
Macbeth,1,3,231,Two truths are told
Macbeth,1,3,232,As happy prologues to the swelling act
Macbeth,1,3,233,"Of the imperial theme.—I thank you, gentlemen."
Macbeth,1,3,234,This supernatural soliciting
Macbeth,1,3,235,"Cannot be ill, cannot be good. If ill,"
Macbeth,1,3,236,Why hath it given me earnest of success
Macbeth,1,3,237,Commencing in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor.
Macbeth,1,3,238,"If good, why do I yield to that suggestion"
Macbeth,1,3,239,Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
Macbeth,1,3,240,And make my seated heart knock at my ribs
Macbeth,1,3,241,Against the use of nature? Present fears
Macbeth,1,3,242,Are less than horrible imaginings.
Macbeth,1,3,243,"My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,"
Macbeth,1,3,244,Shakes so my single state of man
Macbeth,1,3,245,"That function is smothered in surmise,"
Macbeth,1,3,246,And nothing is but what is not.
Banquo,1,3,247,Look how our partner’s rapt.
Macbeth,1,3,248,"If chance will have me king, why, chance may"
Macbeth,1,3,249,crown me
Macbeth,1,3,250,Without my stir.
Banquo,1,3,251,"New honors come upon him,"
Banquo,1,3,252,"Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mold"
Banquo,1,3,253,But with the aid of use.
Macbeth,1,3,254,"Come what come may,"
Macbeth,1,3,255,Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.
Banquo,1,3,256,"Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure."
Macbeth,1,3,257,Give me your favor. My dull brain was wrought
Macbeth,1,3,258,"With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains"
Macbeth,1,3,259,Are registered where every day I turn
Macbeth,1,3,260,The leaf to read them. Let us toward the King.
Macbeth,1,3,261,"Think upon what hath chanced,"
Macbeth,1,3,262,"and at more time,"
Macbeth,1,3,263,"The interim having weighed it, let us speak"
Macbeth,1,3,264,Our free hearts each to other.
Banquo,1,3,265,Very gladly.
Macbeth,1,3,266,"Till then, enough.—Come, friends."
Duncan,1,4,267,Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not
Duncan,1,4,268,Those in commission yet returned?
Malcolm,1,4,269,"My liege,"
Malcolm,1,4,270,They are not yet come back. But I have spoke
Malcolm,1,4,271,"With one that saw him die, who did report"
Malcolm,1,4,272,"That very frankly he confessed his treasons,"
Malcolm,1,4,273,"Implored your Highness’ pardon, and set forth"
Malcolm,1,4,274,A deep repentance. Nothing in his life
Malcolm,1,4,275,Became him like the leaving it. He died
Malcolm,1,4,276,As one that had been studied in his death
Malcolm,1,4,277,To throw away the dearest thing he owed
Malcolm,1,4,278,As ’twere a careless trifle.
Duncan,1,4,279,There’s no art
Duncan,1,4,280,To find the mind’s construction in the face.
Duncan,1,4,281,He was a gentleman on whom I built
Duncan,1,4,282,An absolute trust.
Duncan,1,4,283,"O worthiest cousin,"
Duncan,1,4,284,The sin of my ingratitude even now
Duncan,1,4,285,Was heavy on me. Thou art so far before
Duncan,1,4,286,That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
Duncan,1,4,287,"To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,"
Duncan,1,4,288,That the proportion both of thanks and payment
Duncan,1,4,289,"Might have been mine! Only I have left to say,"
Duncan,1,4,290,More is thy due than more than all can pay.
Macbeth,1,4,291,The service and the loyalty I owe
Macbeth,1,4,292,In doing it pays itself. Your Highness’ part
Macbeth,1,4,293,"Is to receive our duties, and our duties"
Macbeth,1,4,294,"Are to your throne and state children and servants,"
Macbeth,1,4,295,Which do but what they should by doing everything
Macbeth,1,4,296,Safe toward your love and honor.
Duncan,1,4,297,Welcome hither.
Duncan,1,4,298,I have begun to plant thee and will labor
Duncan,1,4,299,"To make thee full of growing.—Noble Banquo,"
Duncan,1,4,300,That hast no less deserved nor must be known
Duncan,1,4,301,"No less to have done so, let me enfold thee"
Duncan,1,4,302,And hold thee to my heart.
Banquo,1,4,303,"There, if I grow,"
Banquo,1,4,304,The harvest is your own.
Duncan,1,4,305,"My plenteous joys,"
Duncan,1,4,306,"Wanton in fullness, seek to hide themselves"
Duncan,1,4,307,"In drops of sorrow.—Sons, kinsmen, thanes,"
Duncan,1,4,308,"And you whose places are the nearest, know"
Duncan,1,4,309,We will establish our estate upon
Duncan,1,4,310,"Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter"
Duncan,1,4,311,The Prince of Cumberland; which honor must
Duncan,1,4,312,"Not unaccompanied invest him only,"
Duncan,1,4,313,"But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine"
Duncan,1,4,314,On all deservers.—From hence to Inverness
Duncan,1,4,315,And bind us further to you.
Macbeth,1,4,316,The rest is labor which is not used for you.
Macbeth,1,4,317,I’ll be myself the harbinger and make joyful
Macbeth,1,4,318,The hearing of my wife with your approach.
Macbeth,1,4,319,So humbly take my leave.
Duncan,1,4,320,My worthy Cawdor.
Macbeth,1,4,321,The Prince of Cumberland! That is a step
Macbeth,1,4,322,"On which I must fall down or else o’erleap,"
Macbeth,1,4,323,"For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;"
Macbeth,1,4,324,Let not light see my black and deep desires.
Macbeth,1,4,325,"The eye wink at the hand, yet let that be"
Macbeth,1,4,326,"Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see."
Duncan,1,4,327,"True, worthy Banquo. He is full so valiant,"
Duncan,1,4,328,And in his commendations I am fed:
Duncan,1,4,329,"It is a banquet to me.—Let’s after him,"
Duncan,1,4,330,Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome.
Duncan,1,4,331,It is a peerless kinsman.
Lady Macbeth,1,5,332,They met me in the
Lady Macbeth,1,5,333,"day of success, and I have learned by the perfect’st"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,334,report they have more in them than mortal knowledge.
Lady Macbeth,1,5,335,"When I burned in desire to question them further, they"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,336,"made themselves air, into which they vanished."
Lady Macbeth,1,5,337,Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives
Lady Macbeth,1,5,338,"from the King, who all-hailed me Thane of Cawdor,"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,339,"by which title, before, these Weïrd Sisters saluted me"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,340,"and referred me to the coming on of time with Hail,"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,341,king that shalt be. This have I thought good to deliver
Lady Macbeth,1,5,342,"thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,343,might’st not lose the dues of rejoicing by being ignorant
Lady Macbeth,1,5,344,of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it to thy
Lady Macbeth,1,5,345,"heart, and farewell."
Lady Macbeth,1,5,346,"Glamis thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,347,What thou art promised. Yet do I fear thy nature;
Lady Macbeth,1,5,348,It is too full o’ th’ milk of human kindness
Lady Macbeth,1,5,349,"To catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great,"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,350,"Art not without ambition, but without"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,351,The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst
Lady Macbeth,1,5,352,"highly,"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,353,That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false
Lady Macbeth,1,5,354,"And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou ’dst have, great"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,355,"Glamis,"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,356,"That which cries Thus thou must do, if thou have"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,357,"it,"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,358,"And that which rather thou dost fear to do,"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,359,"Than wishest should be undone. Hie thee hither,"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,360,That I may pour my spirits in thine ear
Lady Macbeth,1,5,361,And chastise with the valor of my tongue
Lady Macbeth,1,5,362,"All that impedes thee from the golden round,"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,363,Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
Lady Macbeth,1,5,364,To have thee crowned withal.
Lady Macbeth,1,5,365,What is your tidings?
Messenger,1,5,366,The King comes here tonight.
Lady Macbeth,1,5,367,Thou ’rt mad to say it.
Lady Macbeth,1,5,368,"Is not thy master with him, who, were ’t so,"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,369,Would have informed for preparation?
Messenger,1,5,370,"So please you, it is true. Our thane is coming."
Messenger,1,5,371,"One of my fellows had the speed of him,"
Messenger,1,5,372,"Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more"
Messenger,1,5,373,Than would make up his message.
Lady Macbeth,1,5,374,Give him tending.
Lady Macbeth,1,5,375,He brings great news.
Lady Macbeth,1,5,376,The raven himself is hoarse
Lady Macbeth,1,5,377,That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
Lady Macbeth,1,5,378,"Under my battlements. Come, you spirits"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,379,"That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,380,And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
Lady Macbeth,1,5,381,Of direst cruelty. Make thick my blood.
Lady Macbeth,1,5,382,"Stop up th’ access and passage to remorse,"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,383,That no compunctious visitings of nature
Lady Macbeth,1,5,384,"Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,385,Th’ effect and it. Come to my woman’s breasts
Lady Macbeth,1,5,386,"And take my milk for gall, you murd’ring ministers,"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,387,Wherever in your sightless substances
Lady Macbeth,1,5,388,"You wait on nature’s mischief. Come, thick night,"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,389,"And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,390,"That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,391,Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark
Lady Macbeth,1,5,392,"To cry Hold, hold!"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,393,"Great Glamis, worthy Cawdor,"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,394,Greater than both by the all-hail hereafter!
Lady Macbeth,1,5,395,Thy letters have transported me beyond
Lady Macbeth,1,5,396,"This ignorant present, and I feel now"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,397,The future in the instant.
Macbeth,1,5,398,"My dearest love,"
Macbeth,1,5,399,Duncan comes here tonight.
Lady Macbeth,1,5,400,And when goes hence?
Macbeth,1,5,401,"Tomorrow, as he purposes."
Lady Macbeth,1,5,402,"O, never"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,403,Shall sun that morrow see!
Lady Macbeth,1,5,404,"Your face, my thane, is as a book where men"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,405,"May read strange matters. To beguile the time,"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,406,"Look like the time. Bear welcome in your eye,"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,407,"Your hand, your tongue. Look like th’ innocent"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,408,"flower,"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,409,But be the serpent under ’t. He that’s coming
Lady Macbeth,1,5,410,Must be provided for; and you shall put
Lady Macbeth,1,5,411,"This night’s great business into my dispatch,"
Lady Macbeth,1,5,412,Which shall to all our nights and days to come
Lady Macbeth,1,5,413,Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.
Macbeth,1,5,414,We will speak further.
Lady Macbeth,1,5,415,Only look up clear.
Lady Macbeth,1,5,416,To alter favor ever is to fear.
Lady Macbeth,1,5,417,Leave all the rest to me.
Duncan,1,6,418,This castle hath a pleasant seat. The air
Duncan,1,6,419,Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
Duncan,1,6,420,Unto our gentle senses.
Banquo,1,6,421,"This guest of summer,"
Banquo,1,6,422,"The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,"
Banquo,1,6,423,"By his loved mansionry, that the heaven’s breath"
Banquo,1,6,424,"Smells wooingly here. No jutty, frieze,"
Banquo,1,6,425,"Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird"
Banquo,1,6,426,Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle.
Banquo,1,6,427,"Where they most breed and haunt, I have"
Banquo,1,6,428,"observed,"
Banquo,1,6,429,The air is delicate.
Duncan,1,6,430,"See, see our honored hostess!—"
Duncan,1,6,431,"The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,"
Duncan,1,6,432,Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you
Duncan,1,6,433,How you shall bid God ’ild us for your pains
Duncan,1,6,434,And thank us for your trouble.
Lady Macbeth,1,6,435,"All our service,"
Lady Macbeth,1,6,436,"In every point twice done and then done double,"
Lady Macbeth,1,6,437,Were poor and single business to contend
Lady Macbeth,1,6,438,Against those honors deep and broad wherewith
Lady Macbeth,1,6,439,"Your Majesty loads our house. For those of old,"
Lady Macbeth,1,6,440,"And the late dignities heaped up to them,"
Lady Macbeth,1,6,441,We rest your hermits.
Duncan,1,6,442,Where’s the Thane of Cawdor?
Duncan,1,6,443,We coursed him at the heels and had a purpose
Duncan,1,6,444,"To be his purveyor; but he rides well,"
Duncan,1,6,445,"And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath helped"
Duncan,1,6,446,him
Duncan,1,6,447,"To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,"
Duncan,1,6,448,We are your guest tonight.
Lady Macbeth,1,6,449,Your servants ever
Lady Macbeth,1,6,450,"Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs in compt"
Lady Macbeth,1,6,451,"To make their audit at your Highness’ pleasure,"
Lady Macbeth,1,6,452,Still to return your own.
Duncan,1,6,453,Give me your hand.
Duncan,1,6,454,Conduct me to mine host. We love him highly
Duncan,1,6,455,And shall continue our graces towards him.
Duncan,1,6,456,"By your leave, hostess."
Macbeth,1,7,457,"If it were done when ’tis done, then ’twere well"
Macbeth,1,7,458,It were done quickly. If th’ assassination
Macbeth,1,7,459,Could trammel up the consequence and catch
Macbeth,1,7,460,"With his surcease success, that but this blow"
Macbeth,1,7,461,"Might be the be-all and the end-all here,"
Macbeth,1,7,462,"But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,"
Macbeth,1,7,463,We’d jump the life to come. But in these cases
Macbeth,1,7,464,"We still have judgment here, that we but teach"
Macbeth,1,7,465,"Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return"
Macbeth,1,7,466,To plague th’ inventor. This even-handed justice
Macbeth,1,7,467,Commends th’ ingredience of our poisoned chalice
Macbeth,1,7,468,To our own lips. He’s here in double trust:
Macbeth,1,7,469,"First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,"
Macbeth,1,7,470,"Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,"
Macbeth,1,7,471,"Who should against his murderer shut the door,"
Macbeth,1,7,472,"Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan"
Macbeth,1,7,473,"Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been"
Macbeth,1,7,474,"So clear in his great office, that his virtues"
Macbeth,1,7,475,"Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against"
Macbeth,1,7,476,The deep damnation of his taking-off;
Macbeth,1,7,477,"And pity, like a naked newborn babe"
Macbeth,1,7,478,"Striding the blast, or heaven’s cherubin horsed"
Macbeth,1,7,479,"Upon the sightless couriers of the air,"
Macbeth,1,7,480,"Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,"
Macbeth,1,7,481,That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
Macbeth,1,7,482,"To prick the sides of my intent, but only"
Macbeth,1,7,483,"Vaulting ambition, which o’erleaps itself"
Macbeth,1,7,484,And falls on th’ other—
Macbeth,1,7,485,"How now, what news?"
Lady Macbeth,1,7,486,He has almost supped. Why have you left the
Lady Macbeth,1,7,487,chamber?
Macbeth,1,7,488,Hath he asked for me?
Lady Macbeth,1,7,489,Know you not he has?
Macbeth,1,7,490,We will proceed no further in this business.
Macbeth,1,7,491,"He hath honored me of late, and I have bought"
Macbeth,1,7,492,"Golden opinions from all sorts of people,"
Macbeth,1,7,493,"Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,"
Macbeth,1,7,494,Not cast aside so soon.
Lady Macbeth,1,7,495,Was the hope drunk
Lady Macbeth,1,7,496,Wherein you dressed yourself? Hath it slept since?
Lady Macbeth,1,7,497,"And wakes it now, to look so green and pale"
Lady Macbeth,1,7,498,At what it did so freely? From this time
Lady Macbeth,1,7,499,Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard
Lady Macbeth,1,7,500,To be the same in thine own act and valor
Lady Macbeth,1,7,501,As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that
Lady Macbeth,1,7,502,Which thou esteem’st the ornament of life
Lady Macbeth,1,7,503,"And live a coward in thine own esteem,"
Lady Macbeth,1,7,504,"Letting I dare not wait upon I would,"
Lady Macbeth,1,7,505,Like the poor cat i’ th’ adage?
Macbeth,1,7,506,"Prithee, peace."
Macbeth,1,7,507,I dare do all that may become a man.
Macbeth,1,7,508,Who dares do more is none.
Lady Macbeth,1,7,509,"What beast was ’t,"
Lady Macbeth,1,7,510,"then,"
Lady Macbeth,1,7,511,That made you break this enterprise to me?
Lady Macbeth,1,7,512,"When you durst do it, then you were a man;"
Lady Macbeth,1,7,513,"And to be more than what you were, you would"
Lady Macbeth,1,7,514,Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place
Lady Macbeth,1,7,515,"Did then adhere, and yet you would make both."
Lady Macbeth,1,7,516,"They have made themselves, and that their fitness"
Lady Macbeth,1,7,517,now
Lady Macbeth,1,7,518,"Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know"
Lady Macbeth,1,7,519,How tender ’tis to love the babe that milks me.
Lady Macbeth,1,7,520,"I would, while it was smiling in my face,"
Lady Macbeth,1,7,521,Have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums
Lady Macbeth,1,7,522,"And dashed the brains out, had I so sworn as you"
Lady Macbeth,1,7,523,Have done to this.
Macbeth,1,7,524,If we should fail—
Lady Macbeth,1,7,525,We fail?
Lady Macbeth,1,7,526,But screw your courage to the sticking place
Lady Macbeth,1,7,527,And we’ll not fail. When Duncan is asleep
Lady Macbeth,1,7,528,(Whereto the rather shall his day’s hard journey
Lady Macbeth,1,7,529,"Soundly invite him), his two chamberlains"
Lady Macbeth,1,7,530,Will I with wine and wassail so convince
Lady Macbeth,1,7,531,"That memory, the warder of the brain,"
Lady Macbeth,1,7,532,"Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason"
Lady Macbeth,1,7,533,A limbeck only. When in swinish sleep
Lady Macbeth,1,7,534,"Their drenchèd natures lies as in a death,"
Lady Macbeth,1,7,535,What cannot you and I perform upon
Lady Macbeth,1,7,536,Th’ unguarded Duncan? What not put upon
Lady Macbeth,1,7,537,"His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt"
Lady Macbeth,1,7,538,Of our great quell?
Macbeth,1,7,539,"Bring forth men-children only,"
Macbeth,1,7,540,For thy undaunted mettle should compose
Macbeth,1,7,541,"Nothing but males. Will it not be received,"
Macbeth,1,7,542,When we have marked with blood those sleepy two
Macbeth,1,7,543,"Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,"
Macbeth,1,7,544,That they have done ’t?
Lady Macbeth,1,7,545,"Who dares receive it other,"
Lady Macbeth,1,7,546,As we shall make our griefs and clamor roar
Lady Macbeth,1,7,547,Upon his death?
Macbeth,1,7,548,I am settled and bend up
Macbeth,1,7,549,Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
Macbeth,1,7,550,"Away, and mock the time with fairest show."
Macbeth,1,7,551,False face must hide what the false heart doth
Macbeth,1,7,552,know.
Banquo,2,1,553,"How goes the night, boy?"
Fleance,2,1,554,The moon is down. I have not heard the clock.
Banquo,2,1,555,And she goes down at twelve.
Fleance,2,1,556,"I take ’t ’tis later, sir."
Banquo,2,1,557,"Hold, take my sword."
Banquo,2,1,558,There’s husbandry in heaven;
Banquo,2,1,559,Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.
Banquo,2,1,560,"A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,"
Banquo,2,1,561,"And yet I would not sleep. Merciful powers,"
Banquo,2,1,562,Restrain in me the cursèd thoughts that nature
Banquo,2,1,563,Gives way to in repose.
Banquo,2,1,564,Give me my sword.—Who’s
Banquo,2,1,565,there?
Macbeth,2,1,566,A friend.
Banquo,2,1,567,"What, sir, not yet at rest? The King’s abed."
Banquo,2,1,568,"He hath been in unusual pleasure, and"
Banquo,2,1,569,Sent forth great largess to your offices.
Banquo,2,1,570,"This diamond he greets your wife withal,"
Banquo,2,1,571,"By the name of most kind hostess, and shut up"
Banquo,2,1,572,In measureless content.
Macbeth,2,1,573,"Being unprepared,"
Macbeth,2,1,574,"Our will became the servant to defect,"
Macbeth,2,1,575,Which else should free have wrought.
Banquo,2,1,576,All’s well.
Banquo,2,1,577,I dreamt last night of the three Weïrd Sisters.
Banquo,2,1,578,To you they have showed some truth.
Macbeth,2,1,579,I think not of
Macbeth,2,1,580,them.
Macbeth,2,1,581,"Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,"
Macbeth,2,1,582,We would spend it in some words upon that
Macbeth,2,1,583,"business,"
Macbeth,2,1,584,If you would grant the time.
Banquo,2,1,585,At your kind’st leisure.
Macbeth,2,1,586,"If you shall cleave to my consent, when ’tis,"
Macbeth,2,1,587,It shall make honor for you.
Banquo,2,1,588,So I lose none
Banquo,2,1,589,"In seeking to augment it, but still keep"
Banquo,2,1,590,"My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,"
Banquo,2,1,591,I shall be counseled.
Macbeth,2,1,592,Good repose the while.
Banquo,2,1,593,"Thanks, sir. The like to you."
Macbeth,2,1,594,"Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,"
Macbeth,2,1,595,She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.
Macbeth,2,1,596,"Is this a dagger which I see before me,"
Macbeth,2,1,597,"The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch"
Macbeth,2,1,598,thee.
Macbeth,2,1,599,"I have thee not, and yet I see thee still."
Macbeth,2,1,600,"Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible"
Macbeth,2,1,601,To feeling as to sight? Or art thou but
Macbeth,2,1,602,"A dagger of the mind, a false creation"
Macbeth,2,1,603,Proceeding from the heat-oppressèd brain?
Macbeth,2,1,604,"I see thee yet, in form as palpable"
Macbeth,2,1,605,As this which now I draw.
Macbeth,2,1,606,"Thou marshal’st me the way that I was going,"
Macbeth,2,1,607,And such an instrument I was to use.
Macbeth,2,1,608,Mine eyes are made the fools o’ th’ other senses
Macbeth,2,1,609,"Or else worth all the rest. I see thee still,"
Macbeth,2,1,610,"And, on thy blade and dudgeon, gouts of blood,"
Macbeth,2,1,611,Which was not so before. There’s no such thing.
Macbeth,2,1,612,It is the bloody business which informs
Macbeth,2,1,613,Thus to mine eyes. Now o’er the one-half world
Macbeth,2,1,614,"Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse"
Macbeth,2,1,615,The curtained sleep. Witchcraft celebrates
Macbeth,2,1,616,"Pale Hecate’s off’rings, and withered murder,"
Macbeth,2,1,617,"Alarumed by his sentinel, the wolf,"
Macbeth,2,1,618,"Whose howl’s his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,"
Macbeth,2,1,619,"With Tarquin’s ravishing strides, towards his"
Macbeth,2,1,620,design
Macbeth,2,1,621,"Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,"
Macbeth,2,1,622,"Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear"
Macbeth,2,1,623,Thy very stones prate of my whereabouts
Macbeth,2,1,624,"And take the present horror from the time,"
Macbeth,2,1,625,"Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives."
Macbeth,2,1,626,Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
Macbeth,2,1,627,"I go, and it is done. The bell invites me."
Macbeth,2,1,628,"Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell"
Macbeth,2,1,629,That summons thee to heaven or to hell.
Lady Macbeth,2,2,630,That which hath made them drunk hath made me
Lady Macbeth,2,2,631,bold.
Lady Macbeth,2,2,632,What hath quenched them hath given me fire.
Lady Macbeth,2,2,633,Hark!—Peace.
Lady Macbeth,2,2,634,"It was the owl that shrieked, the fatal bellman,"
Lady Macbeth,2,2,635,Which gives the stern’st good-night. He is about it.
Lady Macbeth,2,2,636,"The doors are open, and the surfeited grooms"
Lady Macbeth,2,2,637,Do mock their charge with snores. I have drugged
Lady Macbeth,2,2,638,"their possets,"
Lady Macbeth,2,2,639,That death and nature do contend about them
Lady Macbeth,2,2,640,Whether they live or die.
Macbeth,2,2,641,"Who’s there? what, ho!"
Lady Macbeth,2,2,642,"Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,"
Lady Macbeth,2,2,643,And ’tis not done. Th’ attempt and not the deed
Lady Macbeth,2,2,644,Confounds us. Hark!—I laid their daggers ready;
Lady Macbeth,2,2,645,He could not miss ’em. Had he not resembled
Lady Macbeth,2,2,646,"My father as he slept, I had done ’t."
Lady Macbeth,2,2,647,My husband?
Macbeth,2,2,648,I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?
Lady Macbeth,2,2,649,I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
Lady Macbeth,2,2,650,Did not you speak?
Macbeth,2,2,651,When?
Lady Macbeth,2,2,652,Now.
Macbeth,2,2,653,As I descended?
Lady Macbeth,2,2,654,Ay.
Macbeth,2,2,655,Hark!—Who lies i’ th’ second chamber?
Lady Macbeth,2,2,656,Donalbain.
Macbeth,2,2,657,This is a sorry sight.
Lady Macbeth,2,2,658,"A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight."
Macbeth,2,2,659,"There’s one did laugh in ’s sleep, and one cried"
Macbeth,2,2,660,Murder!
Macbeth,2,2,661,That they did wake each other. I stood and heard
Macbeth,2,2,662,them.
Macbeth,2,2,663,But they did say their prayers and addressed them
Macbeth,2,2,664,Again to sleep.
Lady Macbeth,2,2,665,There are two lodged together.
Macbeth,2,2,666,"One cried God bless us and Amen the other,"
Macbeth,2,2,667,"As they had seen me with these hangman’s hands,"
Macbeth,2,2,668,List’ning their fear. I could not say Amen
Macbeth,2,2,669,When they did say God bless us.
Lady Macbeth,2,2,670,Consider it not so deeply.
Macbeth,2,2,671,But wherefore could not I pronounce Amen?
Macbeth,2,2,672,"I had most need of blessing, and Amen"
Macbeth,2,2,673,Stuck in my throat.
Lady Macbeth,2,2,674,These deeds must not be thought
Lady Macbeth,2,2,675,"After these ways; so, it will make us mad."
Macbeth,2,2,676,Methought I heard a voice cry Sleep no more!
Macbeth,2,2,677,"Macbeth does murder sleep—the innocent sleep,"
Macbeth,2,2,678,"Sleep that knits up the raveled sleave of care,"
Macbeth,2,2,679,"The death of each day’s life, sore labor’s bath,"
Macbeth,2,2,680,"Balm of hurt minds, great nature’s second course,"
Macbeth,2,2,681,Chief nourisher in life’s feast.
Lady Macbeth,2,2,682,What do you mean?
Macbeth,2,2,683,Still it cried Sleep no more! to all the house.
Macbeth,2,2,684,"Glamis hath murdered sleep, and therefore"
Macbeth,2,2,685,Cawdor
Macbeth,2,2,686,Shall sleep no more. Macbeth shall sleep no more.
Lady Macbeth,2,2,687,"Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,"
Lady Macbeth,2,2,688,You do unbend your noble strength to think
Lady Macbeth,2,2,689,So brainsickly of things. Go get some water
Lady Macbeth,2,2,690,And wash this filthy witness from your hand.—
Lady Macbeth,2,2,691,Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
Lady Macbeth,2,2,692,"They must lie there. Go, carry them and smear"
Lady Macbeth,2,2,693,The sleepy grooms with blood.
Macbeth,2,2,694,I’ll go no more.
Macbeth,2,2,695,I am afraid to think what I have done.
Macbeth,2,2,696,Look on ’t again I dare not.
Lady Macbeth,2,2,697,Infirm of purpose!
Lady Macbeth,2,2,698,Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead
Lady Macbeth,2,2,699,Are but as pictures. ’Tis the eye of childhood
Lady Macbeth,2,2,700,"That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,"
Lady Macbeth,2,2,701,"I’ll gild the faces of the grooms withal,"
Lady Macbeth,2,2,702,For it must seem their guilt.
Macbeth,2,2,703,Whence is that
Macbeth,2,2,704,knocking?
Macbeth,2,2,705,How is ’t with me when every noise appalls me?
Macbeth,2,2,706,"What hands are here! Ha, they pluck out mine eyes."
Macbeth,2,2,707,Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood
Macbeth,2,2,708,"Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather"
Macbeth,2,2,709,"The multitudinous seas incarnadine,"
Macbeth,2,2,710,Making the green one red.
Lady Macbeth,2,2,711,"My hands are of your color, but I shame"
Lady Macbeth,2,2,712,To wear a heart so white.
Lady Macbeth,2,2,713,I hear a knocking
Lady Macbeth,2,2,714,At the south entry. Retire we to our chamber.
Lady Macbeth,2,2,715,A little water clears us of this deed.
Lady Macbeth,2,2,716,"How easy is it, then! Your constancy"
Lady Macbeth,2,2,717,Hath left you unattended.
Lady Macbeth,2,2,718,"Hark, more knocking."
Lady Macbeth,2,2,719,"Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us"
Lady Macbeth,2,2,720,And show us to be watchers. Be not lost
Lady Macbeth,2,2,721,So poorly in your thoughts.
Macbeth,2,2,722,To know my deed ’twere best not know myself.
Macbeth,2,2,723,Wake Duncan with thy knocking. I would thou
Macbeth,2,2,724,couldst.
Porter,2,3,725,Here’s a knocking indeed! If a man were
Porter,2,3,726,"porter of hell gate, he should have old turning the"
Porter,2,3,727,"key. Knock, knock, knock! Who’s there, i’"
Porter,2,3,728,th’ name of Beelzebub? Here’s a farmer that hanged
Porter,2,3,729,himself on th’ expectation of plenty. Come in time!
Porter,2,3,730,Have napkins enough about you; here you’ll sweat
Porter,2,3,731,"for ’t. Knock, knock! Who’s there, in th’"
Porter,2,3,732,"other devil’s name? Faith, here’s an equivocator"
Porter,2,3,733,that could swear in both the scales against either
Porter,2,3,734,"scale, who committed treason enough for God’s"
Porter,2,3,735,"sake yet could not equivocate to heaven. O, come in,"
Porter,2,3,736,"equivocator. Knock, knock, knock! Who’s"
Porter,2,3,737,"there? Faith, here’s an English tailor come hither for"
Porter,2,3,738,"stealing out of a French hose. Come in, tailor. Here"
Porter,2,3,739,"you may roast your goose. Knock, knock!"
Porter,2,3,740,Never at quiet.—What are you?—But this place is
Porter,2,3,741,too cold for hell. I’ll devil-porter it no further. I had
Porter,2,3,742,thought to have let in some of all professions that go
Porter,2,3,743,the primrose way to th’ everlasting bonfire.
Porter,2,3,744,"Anon, anon!"
Porter,2,3,745,"I pray you, remember the porter."
Macduff,2,3,746,"Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed"
Macduff,2,3,747,That you do lie so late?
Porter,2,3,748,"Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second"
Porter,2,3,749,"cock, and drink, sir, is a great provoker of three"
Porter,2,3,750,things.
Macduff,2,3,751,What three things does drink especially
Macduff,2,3,752,provoke?
Porter,2,3,753,"Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine."
Porter,2,3,754,"Lechery, sir, it provokes and unprovokes. It provokes"
Porter,2,3,755,"the desire, but it takes away the performance."
Porter,2,3,756,Therefore much drink may be said to be an
Porter,2,3,757,"equivocator with lechery. It makes him, and it"
Porter,2,3,758,"mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it"
Porter,2,3,759,persuades him and disheartens him; makes him
Porter,2,3,760,"stand to and not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates"
Porter,2,3,761,"him in a sleep and, giving him the lie, leaves"
Porter,2,3,762,him.
Macduff,2,3,763,I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
Porter,2,3,764,"That it did, sir, i’ th’ very throat on me; but I"
Porter,2,3,765,"requited him for his lie, and, I think, being too"
Porter,2,3,766,"strong for him, though he took up my legs sometime,"
Porter,2,3,767,yet I made a shift to cast him.
Macduff,2,3,768,Is thy master stirring?
Macduff,2,3,769,Our knocking has awaked him. Here he comes.
Lennox,2,3,770,"Good morrow, noble sir."
Macbeth,2,3,771,"Good morrow, both."
Macduff,2,3,772,"Is the King stirring, worthy thane?"
Macbeth,2,3,773,Not yet.
Macduff,2,3,774,He did command me to call timely on him.
Macduff,2,3,775,I have almost slipped the hour.
Macbeth,2,3,776,I’ll bring you to him.
Macduff,2,3,777,"I know this is a joyful trouble to you,"
Macduff,2,3,778,But yet ’tis one.
Macbeth,2,3,779,The labor we delight in physics pain.
Macbeth,2,3,780,This is the door.
Macduff,2,3,781,"I’ll make so bold to call,"
Macduff,2,3,782,For ’tis my limited service.
Lennox,2,3,783,Goes the King hence today?
Macbeth,2,3,784,He does. He did appoint so.
Lennox,2,3,785,"The night has been unruly. Where we lay,"
Lennox,2,3,786,"Our chimneys were blown down and, as they say,"
Lennox,2,3,787,"Lamentings heard i’ th’ air, strange screams of"
Lennox,2,3,788,"death,"
Lennox,2,3,789,"And prophesying, with accents terrible,"
Lennox,2,3,790,Of dire combustion and confused events
Lennox,2,3,791,New hatched to th’ woeful time. The obscure bird
Lennox,2,3,792,Clamored the livelong night. Some say the Earth
Lennox,2,3,793,Was feverous and did shake.
Macbeth,2,3,794,’Twas a rough night.
Lennox,2,3,795,My young remembrance cannot parallel
Lennox,2,3,796,A fellow to it.
Macduff,2,3,797,"O horror, horror, horror!"
Macduff,2,3,798,Tongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee!
Macbeth,2,3,799,What’s the matter?
Macduff,2,3,800,Confusion now hath made his masterpiece.
Macduff,2,3,801,Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
Macduff,2,3,802,The Lord’s anointed temple and stole thence
Macduff,2,3,803,The life o’ th’ building.
Macbeth,2,3,804,What is ’t you say? The life?
Lennox,2,3,805,Mean you his Majesty?
Macduff,2,3,806,Approach the chamber and destroy your sight
Macduff,2,3,807,With a new Gorgon. Do not bid me speak.
Macduff,2,3,808,See and then speak yourselves.
Macduff,2,3,809,"Awake, awake!"
Macduff,2,3,810,Ring the alarum bell.—Murder and treason!
Macduff,2,3,811,"Banquo and Donalbain, Malcolm, awake!"
Macduff,2,3,812,"Shake off this downy sleep, death’s counterfeit,"
Macduff,2,3,813,"And look on death itself. Up, up, and see"
Macduff,2,3,814,"The great doom’s image. Malcolm, Banquo,"
Macduff,2,3,815,As from your graves rise up and walk like sprites
Macduff,2,3,816,To countenance this horror.—Ring the bell.
Lady Macbeth,2,3,817,"What’s the business,"
Lady Macbeth,2,3,818,That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
Lady Macbeth,2,3,819,"The sleepers of the house? Speak, speak!"
Macduff,2,3,820,"O gentle lady,"
Macduff,2,3,821,’Tis not for you to hear what I can speak.
Macduff,2,3,822,The repetition in a woman’s ear
Macduff,2,3,823,Would murder as it fell.
Macduff,2,3,824,"O Banquo, Banquo,"
Macduff,2,3,825,Our royal master’s murdered.
Lady Macbeth,2,3,826,"Woe, alas!"
Lady Macbeth,2,3,827,"What, in our house?"
Banquo,2,3,828,Too cruel anywhere.—
Banquo,2,3,829,"Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself"
Banquo,2,3,830,And say it is not so.
Macbeth,2,3,831,"Had I but died an hour before this chance,"
Macbeth,2,3,832,I had lived a blessèd time; for from this instant
Macbeth,2,3,833,There’s nothing serious in mortality.
Macbeth,2,3,834,All is but toys. Renown and grace is dead.
Macbeth,2,3,835,"The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees"
Macbeth,2,3,836,Is left this vault to brag of.
Donalbain,2,3,837,What is amiss?
Macbeth,2,3,838,"You are, and do not know ’t."
Macbeth,2,3,839,"The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood"
Macbeth,2,3,840,Is stopped; the very source of it is stopped.
Macduff,2,3,841,Your royal father’s murdered.
Malcolm,2,3,842,"O, by whom?"
Lennox,2,3,843,"Those of his chamber, as it seemed, had done ’t."
Lennox,2,3,844,Their hands and faces were all badged with blood.
Lennox,2,3,845,"So were their daggers, which unwiped we found"
Lennox,2,3,846,Upon their pillows. They stared and were distracted.
Lennox,2,3,847,No man’s life was to be trusted with them.
Macbeth,2,3,848,"O, yet I do repent me of my fury,"
Macbeth,2,3,849,That I did kill them.
Macduff,2,3,850,Wherefore did you so?
Macbeth,2,3,851,"Who can be wise, amazed, temp’rate, and furious,"
Macbeth,2,3,852,"Loyal, and neutral, in a moment? No man."
Macbeth,2,3,853,Th’ expedition of my violent love
Macbeth,2,3,854,"Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,"
Macbeth,2,3,855,"His silver skin laced with his golden blood,"
Macbeth,2,3,856,And his gashed stabs looked like a breach in nature
Macbeth,2,3,857,"For ruin’s wasteful entrance; there the murderers,"
Macbeth,2,3,858,"Steeped in the colors of their trade, their daggers"
Macbeth,2,3,859,Unmannerly breeched with gore. Who could refrain
Macbeth,2,3,860,"That had a heart to love, and in that heart"
Macbeth,2,3,861,Courage to make ’s love known?
Lady Macbeth,2,3,862,"Help me hence, ho!"
Banquo,2,3,863,Look to the lady.
Malcolm,2,3,864,Why do we hold our
Malcolm,2,3,865,"tongues,"
Malcolm,2,3,866,That most may claim this argument for ours?
Donalbain,2,3,867,"What should be spoken here, where our fate,"
Donalbain,2,3,868,"Hid in an auger hole, may rush and seize us?"
Donalbain,2,3,869,Let’s away. Our tears are not yet brewed.
Malcolm,2,3,870,Nor our strong sorrow upon the foot of motion.
Banquo,2,3,871,Look to the lady.
Banquo,2,3,872,"And when we have our naked frailties hid,"
Banquo,2,3,873,"That suffer in exposure, let us meet"
Banquo,2,3,874,And question this most bloody piece of work
Banquo,2,3,875,To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us.
Banquo,2,3,876,"In the great hand of God I stand, and thence"
Banquo,2,3,877,Against the undivulged pretense I fight
Banquo,2,3,878,Of treasonous malice.
Macduff,2,3,879,And so do I.
Lennox,2,3,880,So all.
Macbeth,2,3,881,Let’s briefly put on manly readiness
Macbeth,2,3,882,And meet i’ th’ hall together.
Lennox,2,3,883,Well contented.
Malcolm,2,3,884,What will you do? Let’s not consort with them.
Malcolm,2,3,885,To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
Malcolm,2,3,886,Which the false man does easy. I’ll to England.
Donalbain,2,3,887,To Ireland I. Our separated fortune
Donalbain,2,3,888,"Shall keep us both the safer. Where we are,"
Donalbain,2,3,889,"There’s daggers in men’s smiles. The near in blood,"
Donalbain,2,3,890,The nearer bloody.
Malcolm,2,3,891,This murderous shaft that’s shot
Malcolm,2,3,892,"Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way"
Malcolm,2,3,893,"Is to avoid the aim. Therefore to horse,"
Malcolm,2,3,894,And let us not be dainty of leave-taking
Malcolm,2,3,895,But shift away. There’s warrant in that theft
Malcolm,2,3,896,Which steals itself when there’s no mercy left.
Old Man,2,4,897,"Threescore and ten I can remember well,"
Old Man,2,4,898,Within the volume of which time I have seen
Old Man,2,4,899,"Hours dreadful and things strange, but this sore"
Old Man,2,4,900,night
Old Man,2,4,901,Hath trifled former knowings.
Ross,2,4,902,"Ha, good father,"
Ross,2,4,903,"Thou seest the heavens, as troubled with man’s act,"
Ross,2,4,904,"Threatens his bloody stage. By th’ clock ’tis day,"
Ross,2,4,905,And yet dark night strangles the traveling lamp.
Ross,2,4,906,Is ’t night’s predominance or the day’s shame
Ross,2,4,907,That darkness does the face of earth entomb
Ross,2,4,908,When living light should kiss it?
Old Man,2,4,909,"’Tis unnatural,"
Old Man,2,4,910,Even like the deed that’s done. On Tuesday last
Old Man,2,4,911,"A falcon, tow’ring in her pride of place,"
Old Man,2,4,912,Was by a mousing owl hawked at and killed.
Ross,2,4,913,And Duncan’s horses (a thing most strange and
Ross,2,4,914,"certain),"
Ross,2,4,915,"Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,"
Ross,2,4,916,"Turned wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,"
Ross,2,4,917,"Contending ’gainst obedience, as they would"
Ross,2,4,918,Make war with mankind.
Old Man,2,4,919,’Tis said they eat each
Old Man,2,4,920,other.
Ross,2,4,921,"They did so, to th’ amazement of mine eyes"
Ross,2,4,922,That looked upon ’t.
Ross,2,4,923,Here comes the good
Ross,2,4,924,Macduff.—
Ross,2,4,925,"How goes the world, sir, now?"
Macduff,2,4,926,"Why, see you not?"
Ross,2,4,927,Is ’t known who did this more than bloody deed?
Macduff,2,4,928,Those that Macbeth hath slain.
Ross,2,4,929,"Alas the day,"
Ross,2,4,930,What good could they pretend?
Macduff,2,4,931,They were suborned.
Macduff,2,4,932,"Malcolm and Donalbain, the King’s two sons,"
Macduff,2,4,933,"Are stol’n away and fled, which puts upon them"
Macduff,2,4,934,Suspicion of the deed.
Ross,2,4,935,’Gainst nature still!
Ross,2,4,936,"Thriftless ambition, that will ravin up"
Ross,2,4,937,Thine own lives’ means. Then ’tis most like
Ross,2,4,938,The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.
Macduff,2,4,939,He is already named and gone to Scone
Macduff,2,4,940,To be invested.
Ross,2,4,941,Where is Duncan’s body?
Macduff,2,4,942,"Carried to Colmekill,"
Macduff,2,4,943,The sacred storehouse of his predecessors
Macduff,2,4,944,And guardian of their bones.
Ross,2,4,945,Will you to Scone?
Macduff,2,4,946,"No, cousin, I’ll to Fife."
Ross,2,4,947,"Well, I will thither."
Macduff,2,4,948,"Well, may you see things well done there. Adieu,"
Macduff,2,4,949,Lest our old robes sit easier than our new.
Ross,2,4,950,"Farewell, father."
Old Man,2,4,951,God’s benison go with you and with those
Old Man,2,4,952,That would make good of bad and friends of foes.
Banquo,3,1,953,"Thou hast it now—king, Cawdor, Glamis, all"
Banquo,3,1,954,"As the Weïrd Women promised, and I fear"
Banquo,3,1,955,Thou played’st most foully for ’t. Yet it was said
Banquo,3,1,956,"It should not stand in thy posterity,"
Banquo,3,1,957,But that myself should be the root and father
Banquo,3,1,958,Of many kings. If there come truth from them
Banquo,3,1,959,"(As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine)"
Banquo,3,1,960,"Why, by the verities on thee made good,"
Banquo,3,1,961,"May they not be my oracles as well,"
Banquo,3,1,962,"And set me up in hope? But hush, no more."
Macbeth,3,1,963,Here’s our chief guest.
Lady Macbeth,3,1,964,"If he had been forgotten,"
Lady Macbeth,3,1,965,It had been as a gap in our great feast
Lady Macbeth,3,1,966,And all-thing unbecoming.
Macbeth,3,1,967,"Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir,"
Macbeth,3,1,968,And I’ll request your presence.
Banquo,3,1,969,Let your Highness
Banquo,3,1,970,"Command upon me, to the which my duties"
Banquo,3,1,971,Are with a most indissoluble tie
Banquo,3,1,972,Forever knit.
Macbeth,3,1,973,Ride you this afternoon?
Lennox,3,1,974,"Ay, my good lord."
Macbeth,3,1,975,We should have else desired your good advice
Macbeth,3,1,976,(Which still hath been both grave and prosperous)
Macbeth,3,1,977,"In this day’s council, but we’ll take tomorrow."
Macbeth,3,1,978,Is ’t far you ride?
Banquo,3,1,979,"As far, my lord, as will fill up the time"
Banquo,3,1,980,"’Twixt this and supper. Go not my horse the better,"
Banquo,3,1,981,I must become a borrower of the night
Banquo,3,1,982,For a dark hour or twain.
Macbeth,3,1,983,Fail not our feast.
Banquo,3,1,984,"My lord, I will not."
Macbeth,3,1,985,We hear our bloody cousins are bestowed
Macbeth,3,1,986,"In England and in Ireland, not confessing"
Macbeth,3,1,987,"Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers"
Macbeth,3,1,988,"With strange invention. But of that tomorrow,"
Macbeth,3,1,989,When therewithal we shall have cause of state
Macbeth,3,1,990,"Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse. Adieu,"
Macbeth,3,1,991,Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?
Banquo,3,1,992,"Ay, my good lord. Our time does call upon ’s."
Macbeth,3,1,993,"I wish your horses swift and sure of foot,"
Macbeth,3,1,994,And so I do commend you to their backs.
Macbeth,3,1,995,Farewell.
Macbeth,3,1,996,Let every man be master of his time
Macbeth,3,1,997,Till seven at night. To make society
Macbeth,3,1,998,"The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself"
Macbeth,3,1,999,"Till suppertime alone. While then, God be with you."
Macbeth,3,1,1000,"Sirrah, a word with you. Attend those men"
Macbeth,3,1,1001,Our pleasure?
Servant,3,1,1002,"They are, my lord, without the palace gate."
Macbeth,3,1,1003,Bring them before us.
Macbeth,3,1,1004,"To be thus is nothing,"
Macbeth,3,1,1005,But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo
Macbeth,3,1,1006,"Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature"
Macbeth,3,1,1007,Reigns that which would be feared. ’Tis much he
Macbeth,3,1,1008,"dares,"
Macbeth,3,1,1009,And to that dauntless temper of his mind
Macbeth,3,1,1010,He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor
Macbeth,3,1,1011,To act in safety. There is none but he
Macbeth,3,1,1012,Whose being I do fear; and under him
Macbeth,3,1,1013,"My genius is rebuked, as it is said"
Macbeth,3,1,1014,Mark Antony’s was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
Macbeth,3,1,1015,When first they put the name of king upon me
Macbeth,3,1,1016,"And bade them speak to him. Then, prophet-like,"
Macbeth,3,1,1017,They hailed him father to a line of kings.
Macbeth,3,1,1018,Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown
Macbeth,3,1,1019,"And put a barren scepter in my grip,"
Macbeth,3,1,1020,"Thence to be wrenched with an unlineal hand,"
Macbeth,3,1,1021,"No son of mine succeeding. If ’t be so,"
Macbeth,3,1,1022,For Banquo’s issue have I filed my mind;
Macbeth,3,1,1023,"For them the gracious Duncan have I murdered,"
Macbeth,3,1,1024,Put rancors in the vessel of my peace
Macbeth,3,1,1025,"Only for them, and mine eternal jewel"
Macbeth,3,1,1026,Given to the common enemy of man
Macbeth,3,1,1027,"To make them kings, the seeds of Banquo kings."
Macbeth,3,1,1028,"Rather than so, come fate into the list,"
Macbeth,3,1,1029,And champion me to th’ utterance.—Who’s there?
Macbeth,3,1,1030,"Now go to the door, and stay there"
Macbeth,3,1,1031,till we call.
Macbeth,3,1,1032,Was it not yesterday we spoke together?
First Murderer,3,1,1033,"It was, so please your Highness."
Macbeth,3,1,1034,"Well then, now"
Macbeth,3,1,1035,Have you considered of my speeches? Know
Macbeth,3,1,1036,"That it was he, in the times past, which held you"
Macbeth,3,1,1037,"So under fortune, which you thought had been"
Macbeth,3,1,1038,Our innocent self. This I made good to you
Macbeth,3,1,1039,"In our last conference, passed in probation with you"
Macbeth,3,1,1040,"How you were borne in hand, how crossed, the"
Macbeth,3,1,1041,"instruments,"
Macbeth,3,1,1042,"Who wrought with them, and all things else that"
Macbeth,3,1,1043,might
Macbeth,3,1,1044,To half a soul and to a notion crazed
Macbeth,3,1,1045,Say Thus did Banquo.
First Murderer,3,1,1046,You made it known to us.
Macbeth,3,1,1047,"I did so, and went further, which is now"
Macbeth,3,1,1048,Our point of second meeting. Do you find
Macbeth,3,1,1049,Your patience so predominant in your nature
Macbeth,3,1,1050,That you can let this go? Are you so gospeled
Macbeth,3,1,1051,"To pray for this good man and for his issue,"
Macbeth,3,1,1052,Whose heavy hand hath bowed you to the grave
Macbeth,3,1,1053,And beggared yours forever?
First Murderer,3,1,1054,"We are men, my liege."
Macbeth,3,1,1055,"Ay, in the catalogue you go for men,"
Macbeth,3,1,1056,"As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels,"
Macbeth,3,1,1057,"curs,"
Macbeth,3,1,1058,"Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clept"
Macbeth,3,1,1059,All by the name of dogs. The valued file
Macbeth,3,1,1060,"Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,"
Macbeth,3,1,1061,"The housekeeper, the hunter, every one"
Macbeth,3,1,1062,According to the gift which bounteous nature
Macbeth,3,1,1063,Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive
Macbeth,3,1,1064,"Particular addition, from the bill"
Macbeth,3,1,1065,That writes them all alike. And so of men.
Macbeth,3,1,1066,"Now, if you have a station in the file,"
Macbeth,3,1,1067,"Not i’ th’ worst rank of manhood, say ’t,"
Macbeth,3,1,1068,And I will put that business in your bosoms
Macbeth,3,1,1069,"Whose execution takes your enemy off,"
Macbeth,3,1,1070,"Grapples you to the heart and love of us,"
Macbeth,3,1,1071,"Who wear our health but sickly in his life,"
Macbeth,3,1,1072,Which in his death were perfect.
Second Murderer,3,1,1073,"I am one, my liege,"
Second Murderer,3,1,1074,Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
Second Murderer,3,1,1075,Hath so incensed that I am reckless what
Second Murderer,3,1,1076,I do to spite the world.
First Murderer,3,1,1077,And I another
First Murderer,3,1,1078,"So weary with disasters, tugged with fortune,"
First Murderer,3,1,1079,"That I would set my life on any chance,"
First Murderer,3,1,1080,To mend it or be rid on ’t.
Macbeth,3,1,1081,Both of you
Macbeth,3,1,1082,Know Banquo was your enemy.
Second Murderer,3,1,1083,"True, my lord."
Macbeth,3,1,1084,"So is he mine, and in such bloody distance"
Macbeth,3,1,1085,That every minute of his being thrusts
Macbeth,3,1,1086,Against my near’st of life. And though I could
Macbeth,3,1,1087,With barefaced power sweep him from my sight
Macbeth,3,1,1088,"And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,"
Macbeth,3,1,1089,"For certain friends that are both his and mine,"
Macbeth,3,1,1090,"Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall"
Macbeth,3,1,1091,Who I myself struck down. And thence it is
Macbeth,3,1,1092,"That I to your assistance do make love,"
Macbeth,3,1,1093,Masking the business from the common eye
Macbeth,3,1,1094,For sundry weighty reasons.
Second Murderer,3,1,1095,"We shall, my lord,"
Second Murderer,3,1,1096,Perform what you command us.
First Murderer,3,1,1097,Though our lives—
Macbeth,3,1,1098,Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at
Macbeth,3,1,1099,most
Macbeth,3,1,1100,"I will advise you where to plant yourselves,"
Macbeth,3,1,1101,"Acquaint you with the perfect spy o’ th’ time,"
Macbeth,3,1,1102,"The moment on ’t, for ’t must be done tonight"
Macbeth,3,1,1103,And something from the palace; always thought
Macbeth,3,1,1104,That I require a clearness. And with him
Macbeth,3,1,1105,(To leave no rubs nor botches in the work)
Macbeth,3,1,1106,"Fleance, his son, that keeps him company,"
Macbeth,3,1,1107,Whose absence is no less material to me
Macbeth,3,1,1108,"Than is his father’s, must embrace the fate"
Macbeth,3,1,1109,Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart.
Macbeth,3,1,1110,I’ll come to you anon.
First Murderer,3,1,1111,"We are resolved, my lord."
Macbeth,3,1,1112,I’ll call upon you straight. Abide within.
Macbeth,3,1,1113,"It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul’s flight,"
Macbeth,3,1,1114,"If it find heaven, must find it out tonight."
Lady Macbeth,3,2,1115,Is Banquo gone from court?
Servant,3,2,1116,"Ay, madam, but returns again tonight."
Lady Macbeth,3,2,1117,Say to the King I would attend his leisure
Lady Macbeth,3,2,1118,For a few words.
Servant,3,2,1119,"Madam, I will."
Lady Macbeth,3,2,1120,"Naught’s had, all’s spent,"
Lady Macbeth,3,2,1121,Where our desire is got without content.
Lady Macbeth,3,2,1122,’Tis safer to be that which we destroy
Lady Macbeth,3,2,1123,Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.
Lady Macbeth,3,2,1124,"How now, my lord, why do you keep alone,"
Lady Macbeth,3,2,1125,"Of sorriest fancies your companions making,"
Lady Macbeth,3,2,1126,Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
Lady Macbeth,3,2,1127,With them they think on? Things without all remedy
Lady Macbeth,3,2,1128,Should be without regard. What’s done is done.
Macbeth,3,2,1129,"We have scorched the snake, not killed it."
Macbeth,3,2,1130,She’ll close and be herself whilst our poor malice
Macbeth,3,2,1131,Remains in danger of her former tooth.
Macbeth,3,2,1132,"But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds"
Macbeth,3,2,1133,"suffer,"
Macbeth,3,2,1134,"Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep"
Macbeth,3,2,1135,In the affliction of these terrible dreams
Macbeth,3,2,1136,"That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,"
Macbeth,3,2,1137,"Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,"
Macbeth,3,2,1138,Than on the torture of the mind to lie
Macbeth,3,2,1139,In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave.
Macbeth,3,2,1140,After life’s fitful fever he sleeps well.
Macbeth,3,2,1141,"Treason has done his worst; nor steel nor poison,"
Macbeth,3,2,1142,"Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing"
Macbeth,3,2,1143,Can touch him further.
Lady Macbeth,3,2,1144,"Come on, gentle my lord,"
Lady Macbeth,3,2,1145,Sleek o’er your rugged looks. Be bright and jovial
Lady Macbeth,3,2,1146,Among your guests tonight.
Macbeth,3,2,1147,"So shall I, love,"
Macbeth,3,2,1148,And so I pray be you. Let your remembrance
Macbeth,3,2,1149,Apply to Banquo; present him eminence
Macbeth,3,2,1150,Both with eye and tongue: unsafe the while that we
Macbeth,3,2,1151,Must lave our honors in these flattering streams
Macbeth,3,2,1152,"And make our faces vizards to our hearts,"
Macbeth,3,2,1153,Disguising what they are.
Lady Macbeth,3,2,1154,You must leave this.
Macbeth,3,2,1155,"O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!"
Macbeth,3,2,1156,Thou know’st that Banquo and his Fleance lives.
Lady Macbeth,3,2,1157,But in them nature’s copy’s not eterne.
Macbeth,3,2,1158,There’s comfort yet; they are assailable.
Macbeth,3,2,1159,Then be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown
Macbeth,3,2,1160,"His cloistered flight, ere to black Hecate’s summons"
Macbeth,3,2,1161,The shard-born beetle with his drowsy hums
Macbeth,3,2,1162,"Hath rung night’s yawning peal, there shall be done"
Macbeth,3,2,1163,A deed of dreadful note.
Lady Macbeth,3,2,1164,What’s to be done?
Macbeth,3,2,1165,"Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,"
Macbeth,3,2,1166,"Till thou applaud the deed.—Come, seeling night,"
Macbeth,3,2,1167,Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day
Macbeth,3,2,1168,And with thy bloody and invisible hand
Macbeth,3,2,1169,Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
Macbeth,3,2,1170,"Which keeps me pale. Light thickens, and the crow"
Macbeth,3,2,1171,Makes wing to th’ rooky wood.
Macbeth,3,2,1172,"Good things of day begin to droop and drowse,"
Macbeth,3,2,1173,Whiles night’s black agents to their preys do
Macbeth,3,2,1174,rouse.—
Macbeth,3,2,1175,"Thou marvel’st at my words, but hold thee still."
Macbeth,3,2,1176,Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
Macbeth,3,2,1177,So prithee go with me.
First Murderer,3,3,1178,But who did bid thee join with us?
Third Murderer,3,3,1179,Macbeth.
Second Murderer,3,3,1180,"He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers"
Second Murderer,3,3,1181,Our offices and what we have to do
Second Murderer,3,3,1182,To the direction just.
First Murderer,3,3,1183,Then stand with us.—
First Murderer,3,3,1184,The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day.
First Murderer,3,3,1185,Now spurs the lated traveler apace
First Murderer,3,3,1186,"To gain the timely inn, and near approaches"
First Murderer,3,3,1187,The subject of our watch.
Third Murderer,3,3,1188,"Hark, I hear horses."
Banquo,3,3,1189,"Give us a light there, ho!"
Second Murderer,3,3,1190,Then ’tis he. The rest
Second Murderer,3,3,1191,That are within the note of expectation
Second Murderer,3,3,1192,Already are i’ th’ court.
First Murderer,3,3,1193,His horses go about.
Third Murderer,3,3,1194,Almost a mile; but he does usually
Third Murderer,3,3,1195,(So all men do) from hence to th’ palace gate
Third Murderer,3,3,1196,Make it their walk.
Second Murderer,3,3,1197,"A light, a light!"
Third Murderer,3,3,1198,’Tis he.
First Murderer,3,3,1199,Stand to ’t.
Banquo,3,3,1200,It will be rain tonight.
First Murderer,3,3,1201,Let it come down!
Banquo,3,3,1202,"O treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!"
Banquo,3,3,1203,Thou mayst revenge—O slave!
Third Murderer,3,3,1204,Who did strike out the light?
First Murderer,3,3,1205,Was ’t not the way?
Third Murderer,3,3,1206,There’s but one down. The son is
Third Murderer,3,3,1207,fled.
Second Murderer,3,3,1208,We have lost best half of our
Second Murderer,3,3,1209,affair.
First Murderer,3,3,1210,"Well, let’s away and say how much is done."
Macbeth,3,4,1211,You know your own degrees; sit down. At first
Macbeth,3,4,1212,"And last, the hearty welcome."
Attendants,3,4,1213,Thanks to your Majesty.
Macbeth,3,4,1214,Ourself will mingle with society
Macbeth,3,4,1215,And play the humble host.
Macbeth,3,4,1216,"Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time"
Macbeth,3,4,1217,We will require her welcome.
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1218,"Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends,"
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1219,For my heart speaks they are welcome.
Macbeth,3,4,1220,"See, they encounter thee with their hearts’ thanks."
Macbeth,3,4,1221,Both sides are even. Here I’ll sit i’ th’ midst.
Macbeth,3,4,1222,Be large in mirth. Anon we’ll drink a measure
Macbeth,3,4,1223,The table round. There’s
Macbeth,3,4,1224,blood upon thy face.
First Murderer,3,4,1225,’Tis Banquo’s then.
Macbeth,3,4,1226,’Tis better thee without than he within.
Macbeth,3,4,1227,Is he dispatched?
First Murderer,3,4,1228,"My lord, his throat is cut. That I did for him."
Macbeth,3,4,1229,"Thou art the best o’ th’ cutthroats,"
Macbeth,3,4,1230,Yet he’s good that did the like for Fleance.
Macbeth,3,4,1231,"If thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil."
First Murderer,3,4,1232,"Most royal sir, Fleance is ’scaped."
Macbeth,3,4,1233,"Then comes my fit again. I had else been perfect,"
Macbeth,3,4,1234,"Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,"
Macbeth,3,4,1235,As broad and general as the casing air.
Macbeth,3,4,1236,"But now I am cabined, cribbed, confined, bound in"
Macbeth,3,4,1237,To saucy doubts and fears.—But Banquo’s safe?
First Murderer,3,4,1238,"Ay, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bides,"
First Murderer,3,4,1239,"With twenty trenchèd gashes on his head,"
First Murderer,3,4,1240,The least a death to nature.
Macbeth,3,4,1241,Thanks for that.
Macbeth,3,4,1242,There the grown serpent lies. The worm that’s fled
Macbeth,3,4,1243,"Hath nature that in time will venom breed,"
Macbeth,3,4,1244,No teeth for th’ present. Get thee gone. Tomorrow
Macbeth,3,4,1245,We’ll hear ourselves again.
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1246,"My royal lord,"
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1247,You do not give the cheer. The feast is sold
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1248,"That is not often vouched, while ’tis a-making,"
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1249,’Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home;
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1250,"From thence, the sauce to meat is ceremony;"
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1251,Meeting were bare without it.
Macbeth,3,4,1252,Sweet remembrancer!—
Macbeth,3,4,1253,"Now, good digestion wait on appetite"
Macbeth,3,4,1254,And health on both!
Lennox,3,4,1255,May ’t please your Highness sit.
Macbeth,3,4,1256,"Here had we now our country’s honor roofed,"
Macbeth,3,4,1257,"Were the graced person of our Banquo present,"
Macbeth,3,4,1258,Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
Macbeth,3,4,1259,Than pity for mischance.
Ross,3,4,1260,"His absence, sir,"
Ross,3,4,1261,Lays blame upon his promise. Please ’t your
Ross,3,4,1262,Highness
Ross,3,4,1263,To grace us with your royal company?
Macbeth,3,4,1264,The table’s full.
Lennox,3,4,1265,"Here is a place reserved, sir."
Macbeth,3,4,1266,Where?
Lennox,3,4,1267,"Here, my good lord. What is ’t that moves your"
Lennox,3,4,1268,Highness?
Macbeth,3,4,1269,Which of you have done this?
Attendants,3,4,1270,"What, my good lord?"
Macbeth,3,4,1271,Thou canst not say I did it. Never shake
Macbeth,3,4,1272,Thy gory locks at me.
Ross,3,4,1273,"Gentlemen, rise. His Highness is not well."
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1274,"Sit, worthy friends. My lord is often thus"
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1275,"And hath been from his youth. Pray you, keep seat."
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1276,The fit is momentary; upon a thought
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1277,He will again be well. If much you note him
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1278,You shall offend him and extend his passion.
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1279,Feed and regard him not.
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1280,Are you a man?
Macbeth,3,4,1281,"Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that"
Macbeth,3,4,1282,Which might appall the devil.
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1283,"O, proper stuff!"
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1284,This is the very painting of your fear.
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1285,This is the air-drawn dagger which you said
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1286,"Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,"
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1287,"Impostors to true fear, would well become"
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1288,"A woman’s story at a winter’s fire,"
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1289,Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1290,"Why do you make such faces? When all’s done,"
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1291,You look but on a stool.
Macbeth,3,4,1292,"Prithee, see there. Behold, look! Lo,"
Macbeth,3,4,1293,how say you?
Macbeth,3,4,1294,"Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.—"
Macbeth,3,4,1295,If charnel houses and our graves must send
Macbeth,3,4,1296,"Those that we bury back, our monuments"
Macbeth,3,4,1297,Shall be the maws of kites.
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1298,"What, quite unmanned in folly?"
Macbeth,3,4,1299,"If I stand here, I saw him."
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1300,"Fie, for shame!"
Macbeth,3,4,1301,"Blood hath been shed ere now, i’ th’ olden time,"
Macbeth,3,4,1302,Ere humane statute purged the gentle weal;
Macbeth,3,4,1303,"Ay, and since too, murders have been performed"
Macbeth,3,4,1304,Too terrible for the ear. The time has been
Macbeth,3,4,1305,"That, when the brains were out, the man would die,"
Macbeth,3,4,1306,And there an end. But now they rise again
Macbeth,3,4,1307,With twenty mortal murders on their crowns
Macbeth,3,4,1308,And push us from our stools. This is more strange
Macbeth,3,4,1309,Than such a murder is.
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1310,"My worthy lord,"
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1311,Your noble friends do lack you.
Macbeth,3,4,1312,I do forget.—
Macbeth,3,4,1313,"Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends."
Macbeth,3,4,1314,"I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing"
Macbeth,3,4,1315,"To those that know me. Come, love and health to"
Macbeth,3,4,1316,all.
Macbeth,3,4,1317,Then I’ll sit down.—Give me some wine. Fill full.
Macbeth,3,4,1318,I drink to th’ general joy o’ th’ whole table
Macbeth,3,4,1319,"And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss."
Macbeth,3,4,1320,"Would he were here! To all, and him we thirst,"
Macbeth,3,4,1321,And all to all.
Attendants,3,4,1322,"Our duties, and the pledge."
Macbeth,3,4,1323,"Avaunt, and quit my sight! Let the earth hide thee."
Macbeth,3,4,1324,Thy bones are marrowless; thy blood is cold;
Macbeth,3,4,1325,Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
Macbeth,3,4,1326,Which thou dost glare with.
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1327,"Think of this, good"
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1328,"peers,"
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1329,But as a thing of custom. ’Tis no other;
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1330,Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.
Macbeth,3,4,1331,"What man dare, I dare."
Macbeth,3,4,1332,"Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,"
Macbeth,3,4,1333,"The armed rhinoceros, or th’ Hyrcan tiger;"
Macbeth,3,4,1334,"Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves"
Macbeth,3,4,1335,Shall never tremble. Or be alive again
Macbeth,3,4,1336,And dare me to the desert with thy sword.
Macbeth,3,4,1337,"If trembling I inhabit then, protest me"
Macbeth,3,4,1338,"The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!"
Macbeth,3,4,1339,"Unreal mock’ry, hence!"
Macbeth,3,4,1340,"Why so, being gone,"
Macbeth,3,4,1341,I am a man again.—Pray you sit still.
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1342,"You have displaced the mirth, broke the good"
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1343,meeting
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1344,With most admired disorder.
Macbeth,3,4,1345,Can such things be
Macbeth,3,4,1346,"And overcome us like a summer’s cloud,"
Macbeth,3,4,1347,Without our special wonder? You make me strange
Macbeth,3,4,1348,Even to the disposition that I owe
Macbeth,3,4,1349,When now I think you can behold such sights
Macbeth,3,4,1350,And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks
Macbeth,3,4,1351,When mine is blanched with fear.
Ross,3,4,1352,"What sights, my"
Ross,3,4,1353,lord?
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1354,"I pray you, speak not. He grows worse and worse."
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1355,"Question enrages him. At once, good night."
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1356,"Stand not upon the order of your going,"
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1357,But go at once.
Lennox,3,4,1358,"Good night, and better health"
Lennox,3,4,1359,Attend his Majesty.
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1360,A kind good night to all.
Macbeth,3,4,1361,"It will have blood, they say; blood will have blood."
Macbeth,3,4,1362,"Stones have been known to move, and trees to"
Macbeth,3,4,1363,speak.
Macbeth,3,4,1364,Augurs and understood relations have
Macbeth,3,4,1365,By maggot pies and choughs and rooks brought
Macbeth,3,4,1366,forth
Macbeth,3,4,1367,The secret’st man of blood.—What is the night?
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1368,"Almost at odds with morning, which is which."
Macbeth,3,4,1369,How say’st thou that Macduff denies his person
Macbeth,3,4,1370,At our great bidding?
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1371,"Did you send to him, sir?"
Macbeth,3,4,1372,I hear it by the way; but I will send.
Macbeth,3,4,1373,There’s not a one of them but in his house
Macbeth,3,4,1374,I keep a servant fee’d. I will tomorrow
Macbeth,3,4,1375,(And betimes I will) to the Weïrd Sisters.
Macbeth,3,4,1376,"More shall they speak, for now I am bent to know"
Macbeth,3,4,1377,"By the worst means the worst. For mine own good,"
Macbeth,3,4,1378,All causes shall give way. I am in blood
Macbeth,3,4,1379,"Stepped in so far that, should I wade no more,"
Macbeth,3,4,1380,Returning were as tedious as go o’er.
Macbeth,3,4,1381,"Strange things I have in head that will to hand,"
Macbeth,3,4,1382,Which must be acted ere they may be scanned.
Lady Macbeth,3,4,1383,"You lack the season of all natures, sleep."
Macbeth,3,4,1384,"Come, we’ll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse"
Macbeth,3,4,1385,Is the initiate fear that wants hard use.
Macbeth,3,4,1386,We are yet but young in deed.
First Witch,3,5,1387,"Why, how now, Hecate? You look angerly."
Hecate,3,5,1388,"Have I not reason, beldams as you are?"
Hecate,3,5,1389,"Saucy and overbold, how did you dare"
Hecate,3,5,1390,To trade and traffic with Macbeth
Hecate,3,5,1391,"In riddles and affairs of death,"
Hecate,3,5,1392,"And I, the mistress of your charms,"
Hecate,3,5,1393,"The close contriver of all harms,"
Hecate,3,5,1394,Was never called to bear my part
Hecate,3,5,1395,Or show the glory of our art?
Hecate,3,5,1396,"And which is worse, all you have done"
Hecate,3,5,1397,"Hath been but for a wayward son,"
Hecate,3,5,1398,"Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,"
Hecate,3,5,1399,"Loves for his own ends, not for you."
Hecate,3,5,1400,"But make amends now. Get you gone,"
Hecate,3,5,1401,And at the pit of Acheron
Hecate,3,5,1402,Meet me i’ th’ morning. Thither he
Hecate,3,5,1403,Will come to know his destiny.
Hecate,3,5,1404,"Your vessels and your spells provide,"
Hecate,3,5,1405,Your charms and everything beside.
Hecate,3,5,1406,I am for th’ air. This night I’ll spend
Hecate,3,5,1407,Unto a dismal and a fatal end.
Hecate,3,5,1408,Great business must be wrought ere noon.
Hecate,3,5,1409,Upon the corner of the moon
Hecate,3,5,1410,There hangs a vap’rous drop profound.
Hecate,3,5,1411,"I’ll catch it ere it come to ground,"
Hecate,3,5,1412,"And that, distilled by magic sleights,"
Hecate,3,5,1413,Shall raise such artificial sprites
Hecate,3,5,1414,As by the strength of their illusion
Hecate,3,5,1415,Shall draw him on to his confusion.
Hecate,3,5,1416,"He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear"
Hecate,3,5,1417,"His hopes ’bove wisdom, grace, and fear."
Hecate,3,5,1418,"And you all know, security"
Hecate,3,5,1419,Is mortals’ chiefest enemy.
Hecate,3,5,1420,"Hark! I am called. My little spirit, see,"
Hecate,3,5,1421,Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me.
First Witch,3,5,1422,"Come, let’s make haste. She’ll soon be back again."
Lennox,3,6,1423,"My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,"
Lennox,3,6,1424,Which can interpret farther. Only I say
Lennox,3,6,1425,Things have been strangely borne. The gracious
Lennox,3,6,1426,Duncan
Lennox,3,6,1427,"Was pitied of Macbeth; marry, he was dead."
Lennox,3,6,1428,"And the right valiant Banquo walked too late,"
Lennox,3,6,1429,"Whom you may say, if ’t please you, Fleance killed,"
Lennox,3,6,1430,For Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late.
Lennox,3,6,1431,Who cannot want the thought how monstrous
Lennox,3,6,1432,It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
Lennox,3,6,1433,"To kill their gracious father? Damnèd fact,"
Lennox,3,6,1434,How it did grieve Macbeth! Did he not straight
Lennox,3,6,1435,In pious rage the two delinquents tear
Lennox,3,6,1436,That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
Lennox,3,6,1437,"Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely, too,"
Lennox,3,6,1438,For ’twould have angered any heart alive
Lennox,3,6,1439,To hear the men deny ’t. So that I say
Lennox,3,6,1440,He has borne all things well. And I do think
Lennox,3,6,1441,That had he Duncan’s sons under his key
Lennox,3,6,1442,"(As, an ’t please heaven, he shall not) they should"
Lennox,3,6,1443,find
Lennox,3,6,1444,What ’twere to kill a father. So should Fleance.
Lennox,3,6,1445,"But peace. For from broad words, and ’cause he"
Lennox,3,6,1446,failed
Lennox,3,6,1447,"His presence at the tyrant’s feast, I hear"
Lennox,3,6,1448,"Macduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell"
Lennox,3,6,1449,Where he bestows himself?
Lord,3,6,1450,The son of Duncan
Lord,3,6,1451,(From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth)
Lord,3,6,1452,Lives in the English court and is received
Lord,3,6,1453,Of the most pious Edward with such grace
Lord,3,6,1454,That the malevolence of fortune nothing
Lord,3,6,1455,Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduff
Lord,3,6,1456,Is gone to pray the holy king upon his aid
Lord,3,6,1457,To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward
Lord,3,6,1458,"That, by the help of these (with Him above"
Lord,3,6,1459,"To ratify the work), we may again"
Lord,3,6,1460,"Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,"
Lord,3,6,1461,"Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,"
Lord,3,6,1462,"Do faithful homage, and receive free honors,"
Lord,3,6,1463,All which we pine for now. And this report
Lord,3,6,1464,Hath so exasperate the King that he
Lord,3,6,1465,Prepares for some attempt of war.
Lennox,3,6,1466,Sent he to Macduff?
Lord,3,6,1467,"He did, and with an absolute Sir, not I,"
Lord,3,6,1468,The cloudy messenger turns me his back
Lord,3,6,1469,"And hums, as who should say You’ll rue the time"
Lord,3,6,1470,That clogs me with this answer.
Lennox,3,6,1471,And that well might
Lennox,3,6,1472,Advise him to a caution t’ hold what distance
Lennox,3,6,1473,His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel
Lennox,3,6,1474,Fly to the court of England and unfold
Lennox,3,6,1475,"His message ere he come, that a swift blessing"
Lennox,3,6,1476,May soon return to this our suffering country
Lennox,3,6,1477,Under a hand accursed.
Lord,3,6,1478,I’ll send my prayers with him.
First Witch,4,1,1479,Thrice the brinded cat hath mewed.
Second Witch,4,1,1480,"Thrice, and once the hedge-pig whined."
Third Witch,4,1,1481,"Harpier cries ’Tis time, ’tis time!"
First Witch,4,1,1482,Round about the cauldron go;
First Witch,4,1,1483,In the poisoned entrails throw.
First Witch,4,1,1484,"Toad, that under cold stone"
First Witch,4,1,1485,Days and nights has thirty-one
First Witch,4,1,1486,"Sweltered venom sleeping got,"
First Witch,4,1,1487,Boil thou first i’ th’ charmèd pot.
First Witch,4,1,1488,"Double, double toil and trouble;"
Third Witch,4,1,1489,"Fire burn, and cauldron bubble."
Second Witch,4,1,1490,Fillet of a fenny snake
Second Witch,4,1,1491,In the cauldron boil and bake.
Second Witch,4,1,1492,"Eye of newt and toe of frog,"
Second Witch,4,1,1493,"Wool of bat and tongue of dog,"
Second Witch,4,1,1494,"Adder’s fork and blindworm’s sting,"
Second Witch,4,1,1495,"Lizard’s leg and howlet’s wing,"
Second Witch,4,1,1496,"For a charm of powerful trouble,"
Second Witch,4,1,1497,Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.
Second Witch,4,1,1498,"Double, double toil and trouble;"
First Witch,4,1,1499,"Fire burn, and cauldron bubble."
Third Witch,4,1,1500,"Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,"
Third Witch,4,1,1501,"Witch’s mummy, maw and gulf"
Third Witch,4,1,1502,"Of the ravined salt-sea shark,"
Third Witch,4,1,1503,"Root of hemlock digged i’ th’ dark,"
Third Witch,4,1,1504,"Liver of blaspheming Jew,"
Third Witch,4,1,1505,Gall of goat and slips of yew
Third Witch,4,1,1506,"Slivered in the moon’s eclipse,"
Third Witch,4,1,1507,"Nose of Turk and Tartar’s lips,"
Third Witch,4,1,1508,Finger of birth-strangled babe
Third Witch,4,1,1509,"Ditch-delivered by a drab,"
Third Witch,4,1,1510,Make the gruel thick and slab.
Third Witch,4,1,1511,Add thereto a tiger’s chaudron
Third Witch,4,1,1512,For th’ ingredience of our cauldron.
First Witch,4,1,1513,"Double, double toil and trouble;"
First Witch,4,1,1514,"Fire burn, and cauldron bubble."
Second Witch,4,1,1515,Cool it with a baboon’s blood.
Second Witch,4,1,1516,Then the charm is firm and good.
Hecate,4,1,1517,"O, well done! I commend your pains,"
Hecate,4,1,1518,And everyone shall share i’ th’ gains.
Hecate,4,1,1519,And now about the cauldron sing
Hecate,4,1,1520,"Like elves and fairies in a ring,"
Hecate,4,1,1521,Enchanting all that you put in.
Second Witch,4,1,1522,"By the pricking of my thumbs,"
Second Witch,4,1,1523,Something wicked this way comes.
Second Witch,4,1,1524,"Open, locks,"
Second Witch,4,1,1525,Whoever knocks.
Macbeth,4,1,1526,"How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags?"
Macbeth,4,1,1527,What is ’t you do?
Second Witch,4,1,1528,A deed without a name.
Macbeth,4,1,1529,I conjure you by that which you profess
Macbeth,4,1,1530,"(Howe’er you come to know it), answer me."
Macbeth,4,1,1531,Though you untie the winds and let them fight
Macbeth,4,1,1532,"Against the churches, though the yeasty waves"
Macbeth,4,1,1533,"Confound and swallow navigation up,"
Macbeth,4,1,1534,Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown
Macbeth,4,1,1535,"down,"
Macbeth,4,1,1536,"Though castles topple on their warders’ heads,"
Macbeth,4,1,1537,Though palaces and pyramids do slope
Macbeth,4,1,1538,"Their heads to their foundations, though the"
Macbeth,4,1,1539,treasure
Macbeth,4,1,1540,Of nature’s germens tumble all together
Macbeth,4,1,1541,"Even till destruction sicken, answer me"
Macbeth,4,1,1542,To what I ask you.
First Witch,4,1,1543,Speak.
Second Witch,4,1,1544,Demand.
Third Witch,4,1,1545,We’ll answer.
First Witch,4,1,1546,Say if th’ hadst rather hear it from our mouths
First Witch,4,1,1547,Or from our masters’.
Macbeth,4,1,1548,Call ’em. Let me see ’em.
First Witch,4,1,1549,Pour in sow’s blood that hath eaten
First Witch,4,1,1550,Her nine farrow; grease that’s sweaten
First Witch,4,1,1551,From the murderers’ gibbet throw
First Witch,4,1,1552,Into the flame.
First Witch,4,1,1553,Come high or low;
Second Witch,4,1,1554,Thyself and office deftly show.
Macbeth,4,1,1555,"Tell me, thou unknown power—"
First Witch,4,1,1556,He knows thy
First Witch,4,1,1557,thought.
First Witch,4,1,1558,Hear his speech but say thou naught.
Spirit 1: Armed Head,4,1,1559,Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! Beware Macduff!
Spirit 1: Armed Head,4,1,1560,Beware the Thane of Fife! Dismiss me. Enough.
Macbeth,4,1,1561,"Whate’er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks."
Macbeth,4,1,1562,Thou hast harped my fear aright. But one word
Macbeth,4,1,1563,more—
First Witch,4,1,1564,He will not be commanded. Here’s another
First Witch,4,1,1565,More potent than the first.
Spirit 2: Bloody Child,4,1,1566,Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!—
Macbeth,4,1,1567,"Had I three ears, I’d hear thee."
Spirit 2: Bloody Child,4,1,1568,"Be bloody, bold, and resolute. Laugh to scorn"
Spirit 2: Bloody Child,4,1,1569,"The power of man, for none of woman born"
Spirit 2: Bloody Child,4,1,1570,Shall harm Macbeth.
Macbeth,4,1,1571,"Then live, Macduff; what need I fear of thee?"
Macbeth,4,1,1572,But yet I’ll make assurance double sure
Macbeth,4,1,1573,"And take a bond of fate. Thou shalt not live,"
Macbeth,4,1,1574,"That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,"
Macbeth,4,1,1575,And sleep in spite of thunder.
Macbeth,4,1,1576,What is this
Macbeth,4,1,1577,That rises like the issue of a king
Macbeth,4,1,1578,And wears upon his baby brow the round
Macbeth,4,1,1579,And top of sovereignty?
Third Witch,4,1,1580,Listen but speak not to ’t.
Spirit 3: Crowned Child,4,1,1581,"Be lion-mettled, proud, and take no care"
Spirit 3: Crowned Child,4,1,1582,"Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are."
Spirit 3: Crowned Child,4,1,1583,Macbeth shall never vanquished be until
Spirit 3: Crowned Child,4,1,1584,Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane Hill
Spirit 3: Crowned Child,4,1,1585,Shall come against him.
Macbeth,4,1,1586,That will never be.
Macbeth,4,1,1587,"Who can impress the forest, bid the tree"
Macbeth,4,1,1588,"Unfix his earthbound root? Sweet bodements, good!"
Macbeth,4,1,1589,"Rebellious dead, rise never till the Wood"
Macbeth,4,1,1590,"Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth"
Macbeth,4,1,1591,"Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath"
Macbeth,4,1,1592,To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart
Macbeth,4,1,1593,"Throbs to know one thing. Tell me, if your art"
Macbeth,4,1,1594,Can tell so much: shall Banquo’s issue ever
Macbeth,4,1,1595,Reign in this kingdom?
Second Witch,4,1,1596,Seek to know no more.
Macbeth,4,1,1597,"I will be satisfied. Deny me this,"
Macbeth,4,1,1598,And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know!
Macbeth,4,1,1599,Why sinks that cauldron? And what noise is this?
Second Witch,4,1,1600,Show.
First Witch,4,1,1601,Show.
First Witch,4,1,1602,Show.
First Witch,4,1,1603,Show his eyes and grieve his heart.
First Witch,4,1,1604,Come like shadows; so depart.
Macbeth,4,1,1605,Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo. Down!
Macbeth,4,1,1606,"Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs. And thy hair,"
Macbeth,4,1,1607,"Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first."
Macbeth,4,1,1608,"A third is like the former.—Filthy hags,"
Macbeth,4,1,1609,"Why do you show me this?—A fourth? Start, eyes!"
Macbeth,4,1,1610,"What, will the line stretch out to th’ crack of doom?"
Macbeth,4,1,1611,Another yet? A seventh? I’ll see no more.
Macbeth,4,1,1612,And yet the eighth appears who bears a glass
Macbeth,4,1,1613,"Which shows me many more, and some I see"
Macbeth,4,1,1614,That twofold balls and treble scepters carry.
Macbeth,4,1,1615,"Horrible sight! Now I see ’tis true,"
Macbeth,4,1,1616,For the blood-boltered Banquo smiles upon me
Macbeth,4,1,1617,And points at them for his.
Macbeth,4,1,1618,"What, is this so?"
First Witch,4,1,1619,"Ay, sir, all this is so. But why"
First Witch,4,1,1620,Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
First Witch,4,1,1621,"Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites"
First Witch,4,1,1622,And show the best of our delights.
First Witch,4,1,1623,I’ll charm the air to give a sound
First Witch,4,1,1624,"While you perform your antic round,"
First Witch,4,1,1625,That this great king may kindly say
First Witch,4,1,1626,Our duties did his welcome pay.
Macbeth,4,1,1627,Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour
Macbeth,4,1,1628,Stand aye accursèd in the calendar!—
Macbeth,4,1,1629,"Come in, without there."
Lennox,4,1,1630,What’s your Grace’s will?
Macbeth,4,1,1631,Saw you the Weïrd Sisters?
Lennox,4,1,1632,"No, my lord."
Macbeth,4,1,1633,Came they not by you?
Lennox,4,1,1634,"No, indeed, my lord."
Macbeth,4,1,1635,"Infected be the air whereon they ride,"
Macbeth,4,1,1636,And damned all those that trust them! I did hear
Macbeth,4,1,1637,The galloping of horse. Who was ’t came by?
Lennox,4,1,1638,"’Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word"
Lennox,4,1,1639,Macduff is fled to England.
Macbeth,4,1,1640,Fled to England?
Banquo,4,1,1641,"Ay, my good lord."
Macbeth,4,1,1642,"Time, thou anticipat’st my dread exploits."
Macbeth,4,1,1643,The flighty purpose never is o’ertook
Macbeth,4,1,1644,Unless the deed go with it. From this moment
Macbeth,4,1,1645,The very firstlings of my heart shall be
Macbeth,4,1,1646,"The firstlings of my hand. And even now,"
Macbeth,4,1,1647,"To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and"
Macbeth,4,1,1648,done:
Macbeth,4,1,1649,"The castle of Macduff I will surprise,"
Macbeth,4,1,1650,"Seize upon Fife, give to th’ edge o’ th’ sword"
Macbeth,4,1,1651,"His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls"
Macbeth,4,1,1652,That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;
Macbeth,4,1,1653,This deed I’ll do before this purpose cool.
Macbeth,4,1,1654,But no more sights!—Where are these gentlemen?
Macbeth,4,1,1655,Come bring me where they are.
Lady Macduff,4,2,1656,What had he done to make him fly the land?
Ross,4,2,1657,"You must have patience, madam."
Lady Macduff,4,2,1658,He had none.
Lady Macduff,4,2,1659,"His flight was madness. When our actions do not,"
Lady Macduff,4,2,1660,Our fears do make us traitors.
Ross,4,2,1661,You know not
Ross,4,2,1662,Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.
Lady Macduff,4,2,1663,"Wisdom? To leave his wife, to leave his babes,"
Lady Macduff,4,2,1664,His mansion and his titles in a place
Lady Macduff,4,2,1665,From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;
Lady Macduff,4,2,1666,"He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren,"
Lady Macduff,4,2,1667,"The most diminutive of birds, will fight,"
Lady Macduff,4,2,1668,"Her young ones in her nest, against the owl."
Lady Macduff,4,2,1669,"All is the fear, and nothing is the love,"
Lady Macduff,4,2,1670,"As little is the wisdom, where the flight"
Lady Macduff,4,2,1671,So runs against all reason.
Ross,4,2,1672,"My dearest coz,"
Ross,4,2,1673,"I pray you school yourself. But for your husband,"
Ross,4,2,1674,"He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows"
Ross,4,2,1675,The fits o’ th’ season. I dare not speak much
Ross,4,2,1676,further;
Ross,4,2,1677,But cruel are the times when we are traitors
Ross,4,2,1678,And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumor
Ross,4,2,1679,"From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,"
Ross,4,2,1680,But float upon a wild and violent sea
Ross,4,2,1681,Each way and move—I take my leave of you.
Ross,4,2,1682,Shall not be long but I’ll be here again.
Ross,4,2,1683,Things at the worst will cease or else climb upward
Ross,4,2,1684,"To what they were before.—My pretty cousin,"
Ross,4,2,1685,Blessing upon you.
Lady Macduff,4,2,1686,"Fathered he is, and yet he’s fatherless."
Ross,4,2,1687,"I am so much a fool, should I stay longer"
Ross,4,2,1688,It would be my disgrace and your discomfort.
Ross,4,2,1689,I take my leave at once.
Lady Macduff,4,2,1690,"Sirrah, your father’s dead."
Lady Macduff,4,2,1691,And what will you do now? How will you live?
Macduff's Son,4,2,1692,"As birds do, mother."
Lady Macduff,4,2,1693,"What, with worms and flies?"
Macduff's Son,4,2,1694,"With what I get, I mean; and so do they."
Lady Macduff,4,2,1695,"Poor bird, thou ’dst never fear the net nor lime,"
Lady Macduff,4,2,1696,The pitfall nor the gin.
Macduff's Son,4,2,1697,"Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set"
Macduff's Son,4,2,1698,for.
Macduff's Son,4,2,1699,"My father is not dead, for all your saying."
Lady Macduff,4,2,1700,"Yes, he is dead. How wilt thou do for a father?"
Macduff's Son,4,2,1701,"Nay, how will you do for a husband?"
Lady Macduff,4,2,1702,"Why, I can buy me twenty at any market."
Macduff's Son,4,2,1703,Then you’ll buy ’em to sell again.
Lady Macduff,4,2,1704,"Thou speak’st with all thy wit,"
Lady Macduff,4,2,1705,"And yet, i’ faith, with wit enough for thee."
Macduff's Son,4,2,1706,"Was my father a traitor, mother?"
Lady Macduff,4,2,1707,"Ay, that he was."
Macduff's Son,4,2,1708,What is a traitor?
Lady Macduff,4,2,1709,"Why, one that swears and lies."
Macduff's Son,4,2,1710,And be all traitors that do so?
Lady Macduff,4,2,1711,Every one that does so is a traitor
Lady Macduff,4,2,1712,and must be hanged.
Macduff's Son,4,2,1713,And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?
Lady Macduff,4,2,1714,Every one.
Macduff's Son,4,2,1715,Who must hang them?
Lady Macduff,4,2,1716,"Why, the honest men."
Macduff's Son,4,2,1717,"Then the liars and swearers are fools, for there"
Macduff's Son,4,2,1718,are liars and swearers enough to beat the honest
Macduff's Son,4,2,1719,men and hang up them.
Lady Macduff,4,2,1720,"Now God help thee, poor monkey! But"
Lady Macduff,4,2,1721,how wilt thou do for a father?
Macduff's Son,4,2,1722,"If he were dead, you’d weep for him. If you would"
Macduff's Son,4,2,1723,"not, it were a good sign that I should quickly have a"
Macduff's Son,4,2,1724,new father.
Lady Macduff,4,2,1725,"Poor prattler, how thou talk’st!"
Messenger,4,2,1726,"Bless you, fair dame. I am not to you known,"
Messenger,4,2,1727,Though in your state of honor I am perfect.
Messenger,4,2,1728,I doubt some danger does approach you nearly.
Messenger,4,2,1729,"If you will take a homely man’s advice,"
Messenger,4,2,1730,Be not found here. Hence with your little ones!
Messenger,4,2,1731,To fright you thus methinks I am too savage;
Messenger,4,2,1732,"To do worse to you were fell cruelty,"
Messenger,4,2,1733,Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve
Messenger,4,2,1734,you!
Messenger,4,2,1735,I dare abide no longer.
Lady Macduff,4,2,1736,Whither should I fly?
Lady Macduff,4,2,1737,I have done no harm. But I remember now
Lady Macduff,4,2,1738,"I am in this earthly world, where to do harm"
Lady Macduff,4,2,1739,"Is often laudable, to do good sometime"
Lady Macduff,4,2,1740,"Accounted dangerous folly. Why then, alas,"
Lady Macduff,4,2,1741,Do I put up that womanly defense
Lady Macduff,4,2,1742,To say I have done no harm?
Lady Macduff,4,2,1743,What are these faces?
Murderers,4,2,1744,Where is your husband?
Lady Macduff,4,2,1745,I hope in no place so unsanctified
Lady Macduff,4,2,1746,Where such as thou mayst find him.
Murderers,4,2,1747,He’s a traitor.
Macduff's Son,4,2,1748,"Thou liest, thou shag-eared villain!"
Murderers,4,2,1749,"What, you egg?"
Murderers,4,2,1750,Young fry of treachery!
Macduff's Son,4,2,1751,He has killed
Macduff's Son,4,2,1752,"me, mother."
Macduff's Son,4,2,1753,"Run away, I pray you."
Malcolm,4,3,1754,Let us seek out some desolate shade and there
Malcolm,4,3,1755,Weep our sad bosoms empty.
Macduff,4,3,1756,Let us rather
Macduff,4,3,1757,"Hold fast the mortal sword and, like good men,"
Macduff,4,3,1758,Bestride our downfall’n birthdom. Each new morn
Macduff,4,3,1759,"New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows"
Macduff,4,3,1760,"Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds"
Macduff,4,3,1761,"As if it felt with Scotland, and yelled out"
Macduff,4,3,1762,Like syllable of dolor.
Malcolm,4,3,1763,"What I believe, I’ll wail;"
Malcolm,4,3,1764,"What know, believe; and what I can redress,"
Malcolm,4,3,1765,"As I shall find the time to friend, I will."
Malcolm,4,3,1766,"What you have spoke, it may be so, perchance."
Malcolm,4,3,1767,"This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,"
Malcolm,4,3,1768,Was once thought honest. You have loved him well.
Malcolm,4,3,1769,"He hath not touched you yet. I am young, but"
Malcolm,4,3,1770,something
Malcolm,4,3,1771,"You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom"
Malcolm,4,3,1772,"To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb"
Malcolm,4,3,1773,T’ appease an angry god.
Macduff,4,3,1774,I am not treacherous.
Malcolm,4,3,1775,But Macbeth is.
Malcolm,4,3,1776,A good and virtuous nature may recoil
Malcolm,4,3,1777,In an imperial charge. But I shall crave your
Malcolm,4,3,1778,pardon.
Malcolm,4,3,1779,"That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose."
Malcolm,4,3,1780,"Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell."
Malcolm,4,3,1781,Though all things foul would wear the brows of
Malcolm,4,3,1782,"grace,"
Malcolm,4,3,1783,Yet grace must still look so.
Macduff,4,3,1784,I have lost my hopes.
Malcolm,4,3,1785,Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
Malcolm,4,3,1786,"Why in that rawness left you wife and child,"
Malcolm,4,3,1787,"Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,"
Malcolm,4,3,1788,"Without leave-taking? I pray you,"
Malcolm,4,3,1789,"Let not my jealousies be your dishonors,"
Malcolm,4,3,1790,"But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,"
Malcolm,4,3,1791,Whatever I shall think.
Macduff,4,3,1792,"Bleed, bleed, poor country!"
Macduff,4,3,1793,"Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,"
Macduff,4,3,1794,For goodness dare not check thee. Wear thou thy
Macduff,4,3,1795,wrongs;
Macduff,4,3,1796,"The title is affeered.—Fare thee well, lord."
Macduff,4,3,1797,I would not be the villain that thou think’st
Macduff,4,3,1798,"For the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s grasp,"
Macduff,4,3,1799,And the rich East to boot.
Malcolm,4,3,1800,Be not offended.
Malcolm,4,3,1801,I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
Malcolm,4,3,1802,I think our country sinks beneath the yoke.
Malcolm,4,3,1803,"It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash"
Malcolm,4,3,1804,Is added to her wounds. I think withal
Malcolm,4,3,1805,There would be hands uplifted in my right;
Malcolm,4,3,1806,And here from gracious England have I offer
Malcolm,4,3,1807,"Of goodly thousands. But, for all this,"
Malcolm,4,3,1808,When I shall tread upon the tyrant’s head
Malcolm,4,3,1809,"Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country"
Malcolm,4,3,1810,"Shall have more vices than it had before,"
Malcolm,4,3,1811,"More suffer, and more sundry ways than ever,"
Malcolm,4,3,1812,By him that shall succeed.
Macduff,4,3,1813,What should he be?
Malcolm,4,3,1814,"It is myself I mean, in whom I know"
Malcolm,4,3,1815,All the particulars of vice so grafted
Malcolm,4,3,1816,"That, when they shall be opened, black Macbeth"
Malcolm,4,3,1817,"Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state"
Malcolm,4,3,1818,"Esteem him as a lamb, being compared"
Malcolm,4,3,1819,With my confineless harms.
Macduff,4,3,1820,Not in the legions
Macduff,4,3,1821,Of horrid hell can come a devil more damned
Macduff,4,3,1822,In evils to top Macbeth.
Malcolm,4,3,1823,"I grant him bloody,"
Malcolm,4,3,1824,"Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,"
Malcolm,4,3,1825,"Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin"
Malcolm,4,3,1826,"That has a name. But there’s no bottom, none,"
Malcolm,4,3,1827,"In my voluptuousness. Your wives, your daughters,"
Malcolm,4,3,1828,"Your matrons, and your maids could not fill up"
Malcolm,4,3,1829,"The cistern of my lust, and my desire"
Malcolm,4,3,1830,All continent impediments would o’erbear
Malcolm,4,3,1831,That did oppose my will. Better Macbeth
Malcolm,4,3,1832,Than such an one to reign.
Macduff,4,3,1833,Boundless intemperance
Macduff,4,3,1834,In nature is a tyranny. It hath been
Macduff,4,3,1835,Th’ untimely emptying of the happy throne
Macduff,4,3,1836,And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
Macduff,4,3,1837,To take upon you what is yours. You may
Macduff,4,3,1838,Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty
Macduff,4,3,1839,And yet seem cold—the time you may so hoodwink.
Macduff,4,3,1840,We have willing dames enough. There cannot be
Macduff,4,3,1841,That vulture in you to devour so many
Macduff,4,3,1842,"As will to greatness dedicate themselves,"
Macduff,4,3,1843,Finding it so inclined.
Malcolm,4,3,1844,With this there grows
Malcolm,4,3,1845,In my most ill-composed affection such
Malcolm,4,3,1846,"A stanchless avarice that, were I king,"
Malcolm,4,3,1847,"I should cut off the nobles for their lands,"
Malcolm,4,3,1848,"Desire his jewels, and this other’s house;"
Malcolm,4,3,1849,And my more-having would be as a sauce
Malcolm,4,3,1850,"To make me hunger more, that I should forge"
Malcolm,4,3,1851,"Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,"
Malcolm,4,3,1852,Destroying them for wealth.
Macduff,4,3,1853,This avarice
Macduff,4,3,1854,"Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root"
Macduff,4,3,1855,"Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been"
Macduff,4,3,1856,The sword of our slain kings. Yet do not fear.
Macduff,4,3,1857,Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will
Macduff,4,3,1858,"Of your mere own. All these are portable,"
Macduff,4,3,1859,With other graces weighed.
Malcolm,4,3,1860,"But I have none. The king-becoming graces,"
Malcolm,4,3,1861,"As justice, verity, temp’rance, stableness,"
Malcolm,4,3,1862,"Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,"
Malcolm,4,3,1863,"Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,"
Malcolm,4,3,1864,I have no relish of them but abound
Malcolm,4,3,1865,"In the division of each several crime,"
Malcolm,4,3,1866,"Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should"
Malcolm,4,3,1867,"Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,"
Malcolm,4,3,1868,"Uproar the universal peace, confound"
Malcolm,4,3,1869,All unity on earth.
Macduff,4,3,1870,"O Scotland, Scotland!"
Malcolm,4,3,1871,"If such a one be fit to govern, speak."
Malcolm,4,3,1872,I am as I have spoken.
Macduff,4,3,1873,Fit to govern?
Macduff,4,3,1874,"No, not to live.—O nation miserable,"
Macduff,4,3,1875,"With an untitled tyrant bloody-sceptered,"
Macduff,4,3,1876,"When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,"
Macduff,4,3,1877,Since that the truest issue of thy throne
Macduff,4,3,1878,By his own interdiction stands accursed
Macduff,4,3,1879,And does blaspheme his breed?—Thy royal father
Macduff,4,3,1880,"Was a most sainted king. The queen that bore thee,"
Macduff,4,3,1881,"Oft’ner upon her knees than on her feet,"
Macduff,4,3,1882,Died every day she lived. Fare thee well.
Macduff,4,3,1883,These evils thou repeat’st upon thyself
Macduff,4,3,1884,"Hath banished me from Scotland.—O my breast,"
Macduff,4,3,1885,Thy hope ends here!
Malcolm,4,3,1886,"Macduff, this noble passion,"
Malcolm,4,3,1887,"Child of integrity, hath from my soul"
Malcolm,4,3,1888,"Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts"
Malcolm,4,3,1889,To thy good truth and honor. Devilish Macbeth
Malcolm,4,3,1890,By many of these trains hath sought to win me
Malcolm,4,3,1891,"Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me"
Malcolm,4,3,1892,From overcredulous haste. But God above
Malcolm,4,3,1893,"Deal between thee and me, for even now"
Malcolm,4,3,1894,I put myself to thy direction and
Malcolm,4,3,1895,"Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure"
Malcolm,4,3,1896,The taints and blames I laid upon myself
Malcolm,4,3,1897,For strangers to my nature. I am yet
Malcolm,4,3,1898,"Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,"
Malcolm,4,3,1899,"Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,"
Malcolm,4,3,1900,"At no time broke my faith, would not betray"
Malcolm,4,3,1901,"The devil to his fellow, and delight"
Malcolm,4,3,1902,No less in truth than life. My first false speaking
Malcolm,4,3,1903,Was this upon myself. What I am truly
Malcolm,4,3,1904,Is thine and my poor country’s to command—
Malcolm,4,3,1905,"Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,"
Malcolm,4,3,1906,"Old Siward with ten thousand warlike men,"
Malcolm,4,3,1907,"Already at a point, was setting forth."
Malcolm,4,3,1908,"Now we’ll together, and the chance of goodness"
Malcolm,4,3,1909,Be like our warranted quarrel. Why are you silent?
Macduff,4,3,1910,Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
Macduff,4,3,1911,’Tis hard to reconcile.
Malcolm,4,3,1912,"Well, more anon.—"
Malcolm,4,3,1913,"Comes the King forth, I pray you?"
Doctor,4,3,1914,"Ay, sir. There are a crew of wretched souls"
Doctor,4,3,1915,That stay his cure. Their malady convinces
Doctor,4,3,1916,"The great assay of art, but at his touch"
Doctor,4,3,1917,(Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand)
Doctor,4,3,1918,They presently amend.
Malcolm,4,3,1919,"I thank you, doctor."
Macduff,4,3,1920,What’s the disease he means?
Malcolm,4,3,1921,’Tis called the evil:
Malcolm,4,3,1922,"A most miraculous work in this good king,"
Malcolm,4,3,1923,Which often since my here-remain in England
Malcolm,4,3,1924,I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven
Malcolm,4,3,1925,"Himself best knows, but strangely visited people"
Malcolm,4,3,1926,"All swoll’n and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,"
Malcolm,4,3,1927,"The mere despair of surgery, he cures,"
Malcolm,4,3,1928,"Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,"
Malcolm,4,3,1929,"Put on with holy prayers; and, ’tis spoken,"
Malcolm,4,3,1930,To the succeeding royalty he leaves
Malcolm,4,3,1931,"The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,"
Malcolm,4,3,1932,"He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,"
Malcolm,4,3,1933,And sundry blessings hang about his throne
Malcolm,4,3,1934,That speak him full of grace.
Macduff,4,3,1935,See who comes here.
Malcolm,4,3,1936,"My countryman, but yet I know him not."
Macduff,4,3,1937,"My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither."
Malcolm,4,3,1938,I know him now.—Good God betimes remove
Malcolm,4,3,1939,The means that makes us strangers!
Ross,4,3,1940,"Sir, amen."
Macduff,4,3,1941,Stands Scotland where it did?
Ross,4,3,1942,"Alas, poor country,"
Ross,4,3,1943,Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot
Ross,4,3,1944,"Be called our mother, but our grave, where nothing"
Ross,4,3,1945,But who knows nothing is once seen to smile;
Ross,4,3,1946,Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rent the air
Ross,4,3,1947,"Are made, not marked; where violent sorrow seems"
Ross,4,3,1948,A modern ecstasy. The dead man’s knell
Ross,4,3,1949,"Is there scarce asked for who, and good men’s lives"
Ross,4,3,1950,"Expire before the flowers in their caps,"
Ross,4,3,1951,Dying or ere they sicken.
Macduff,4,3,1952,O relation too nice and yet too true!
Malcolm,4,3,1953,What’s the newest grief?
Ross,4,3,1954,That of an hour’s age doth hiss the speaker.
Ross,4,3,1955,Each minute teems a new one.
Macduff,4,3,1956,How does my wife?
Ross,4,3,1957,"Why, well."
Macduff,4,3,1958,And all my children?
Ross,4,3,1959,Well too.
Macduff,4,3,1960,The tyrant has not battered at their peace?
Ross,4,3,1961,"No, they were well at peace when I did leave ’em."
Macduff,4,3,1962,Be not a niggard of your speech. How goes ’t?
Ross,4,3,1963,When I came hither to transport the tidings
Ross,4,3,1964,"Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumor"
Ross,4,3,1965,Of many worthy fellows that were out;
Ross,4,3,1966,Which was to my belief witnessed the rather
Ross,4,3,1967,For that I saw the tyrant’s power afoot.
Ross,4,3,1968,Now is the time of help. Your eye in Scotland
Ross,4,3,1969,"Would create soldiers, make our women fight"
Ross,4,3,1970,To doff their dire distresses.
Malcolm,4,3,1971,Be ’t their comfort
Malcolm,4,3,1972,We are coming thither. Gracious England hath
Malcolm,4,3,1973,Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;
Malcolm,4,3,1974,An older and a better soldier none
Malcolm,4,3,1975,That Christendom gives out.
Ross,4,3,1976,Would I could answer
Ross,4,3,1977,This comfort with the like. But I have words
Ross,4,3,1978,"That would be howled out in the desert air,"
Ross,4,3,1979,Where hearing should not latch them.
Macduff,4,3,1980,What concern
Macduff,4,3,1981,they—
Macduff,4,3,1982,"The general cause, or is it a fee-grief"
Macduff,4,3,1983,Due to some single breast?
Ross,4,3,1984,No mind that’s honest
Ross,4,3,1985,"But in it shares some woe, though the main part"
Ross,4,3,1986,Pertains to you alone.
Macduff,4,3,1987,"If it be mine,"
Macduff,4,3,1988,Keep it not from me. Quickly let me have it.
Ross,4,3,1989,"Let not your ears despise my tongue forever,"
Ross,4,3,1990,Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
Ross,4,3,1991,That ever yet they heard.
Macduff,4,3,1992,Hum! I guess at it.
Ross,4,3,1993,"Your castle is surprised, your wife and babes"
Ross,4,3,1994,Savagely slaughtered. To relate the manner
Ross,4,3,1995,Were on the quarry of these murdered deer
Ross,4,3,1996,To add the death of you.
Malcolm,4,3,1997,Merciful heaven!—
Malcolm,4,3,1998,"What, man, ne’er pull your hat upon your brows."
Malcolm,4,3,1999,Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak
Malcolm,4,3,2000,Whispers the o’erfraught heart and bids it break.
Macduff,4,3,2001,My children too?
Ross,4,3,2002,"Wife, children, servants, all that could be found."
Macduff,4,3,2003,And I must be from thence? My wife killed too?
Ross,4,3,2004,I have said.
Malcolm,4,3,2005,Be comforted.
Malcolm,4,3,2006,Let’s make us med’cines of our great revenge
Malcolm,4,3,2007,To cure this deadly grief.
Macduff,4,3,2008,He has no children. All my pretty ones?
Macduff,4,3,2009,Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?
Macduff,4,3,2010,"What, all my pretty chickens and their dam"
Macduff,4,3,2011,At one fell swoop?
Malcolm,4,3,2012,Dispute it like a man.
Macduff,4,3,2013,"I shall do so,"
Macduff,4,3,2014,But I must also feel it as a man.
Macduff,4,3,2015,I cannot but remember such things were
Macduff,4,3,2016,That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on
Macduff,4,3,2017,"And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,"
Macduff,4,3,2018,"They were all struck for thee! Naught that I am,"
Macduff,4,3,2019,"Not for their own demerits, but for mine,"
Macduff,4,3,2020,Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now.
Malcolm,4,3,2021,Be this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief
Malcolm,4,3,2022,Convert to anger. Blunt not the heart; enrage it.
Macduff,4,3,2023,"O, I could play the woman with mine eyes"
Macduff,4,3,2024,"And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,"
Macduff,4,3,2025,Cut short all intermission! Front to front
Macduff,4,3,2026,Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself.
Macduff,4,3,2027,"Within my sword’s length set him. If he ’scape,"
Macduff,4,3,2028,Heaven forgive him too.
Malcolm,4,3,2029,This tune goes manly.
Malcolm,4,3,2030,"Come, go we to the King. Our power is ready;"
Malcolm,4,3,2031,Our lack is nothing but our leave. Macbeth
Malcolm,4,3,2032,"Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above"
Malcolm,4,3,2033,Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you
Malcolm,4,3,2034,may.
Malcolm,4,3,2035,The night is long that never finds the day.
Doctor,5,1,2036,I have two nights watched with you but can
Doctor,5,1,2037,perceive no truth in your report. When was it she
Doctor,5,1,2038,last walked?
Gentlewoman,5,1,2039,"Since his Majesty went into the field, I"
Gentlewoman,5,1,2040,"have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown"
Gentlewoman,5,1,2041,"upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper,"
Gentlewoman,5,1,2042,"fold it, write upon ’t, read it, afterwards seal it, and"
Gentlewoman,5,1,2043,again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast
Gentlewoman,5,1,2044,sleep.
Doctor,5,1,2045,"A great perturbation in nature, to receive at"
Doctor,5,1,2046,once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of
Doctor,5,1,2047,"watching. In this slumb’ry agitation, besides her"
Doctor,5,1,2048,"walking and other actual performances, what at any"
Doctor,5,1,2049,time have you heard her say?
Gentlewoman,5,1,2050,"That, sir, which I will not report after"
Gentlewoman,5,1,2051,her.
Doctor,5,1,2052,"You may to me, and ’tis most meet you"
Doctor,5,1,2053,should.
Gentlewoman,5,1,2054,"Neither to you nor anyone, having no"
Gentlewoman,5,1,2055,witness to confirm my speech.
Gentlewoman,5,1,2056,"Lo you, here she comes. This is her very guise and,"
Gentlewoman,5,1,2057,"upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close."
Doctor,5,1,2058,How came she by that light?
Gentlewoman,5,1,2059,"Why, it stood by her. She has light by"
Gentlewoman,5,1,2060,her continually. ’Tis her command.
Doctor,5,1,2061,You see her eyes are open.
Gentlewoman,5,1,2062,"Ay, but their sense are shut."
Doctor,5,1,2063,What is it she does now? Look how she rubs
Doctor,5,1,2064,her hands.
Gentlewoman,5,1,2065,It is an accustomed action with her to
Gentlewoman,5,1,2066,seem thus washing her hands. I have known her
Gentlewoman,5,1,2067,continue in this a quarter of an hour.
Lady Macbeth,5,1,2068,Yet here’s a spot.
Doctor,5,1,2069,"Hark, she speaks. I will set down what comes"
Doctor,5,1,2070,"from her, to satisfy my remembrance the more"
Doctor,5,1,2071,strongly.
Lady Macbeth,5,1,2072,"Out, damned spot, out, I say! One. Two."
Lady Macbeth,5,1,2073,"Why then, ’tis time to do ’t. Hell is murky. Fie, my"
Lady Macbeth,5,1,2074,"lord, fie, a soldier and afeard? What need we fear"
Lady Macbeth,5,1,2075,"who knows it, when none can call our power to"
Lady Macbeth,5,1,2076,account? Yet who would have thought the old man
Lady Macbeth,5,1,2077,to have had so much blood in him?
Doctor,5,1,2078,Do you mark that?
Lady Macbeth,5,1,2079,The Thane of Fife had a wife. Where is
Lady Macbeth,5,1,2080,"she now? What, will these hands ne’er be clean? No"
Lady Macbeth,5,1,2081,"more o’ that, my lord, no more o’ that. You mar all"
Lady Macbeth,5,1,2082,with this starting.
Doctor,5,1,2083,"Go to, go to. You have known what you should"
Doctor,5,1,2084,not.
Gentlewoman,5,1,2085,"She has spoke what she should not,"
Gentlewoman,5,1,2086,I am sure of that. Heaven knows what she has
Gentlewoman,5,1,2087,known.
Lady Macbeth,5,1,2088,Here’s the smell of the blood still. All
Lady Macbeth,5,1,2089,the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little
Lady Macbeth,5,1,2090,"hand. O, O, O!"
Doctor,5,1,2091,What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely
Doctor,5,1,2092,charged.
Gentlewoman,5,1,2093,I would not have such a heart in my
Gentlewoman,5,1,2094,bosom for the dignity of the whole body.
Doctor,5,1,2095,"Well, well, well."
Gentlewoman,5,1,2096,"Pray God it be, sir."
Doctor,5,1,2097,This disease is beyond my practice. Yet I have
Doctor,5,1,2098,"known those which have walked in their sleep,"
Doctor,5,1,2099,who have died holily in their beds.
Lady Macbeth,5,1,2100,Wash your hands. Put on your nightgown.
Lady Macbeth,5,1,2101,"Look not so pale. I tell you yet again, Banquo’s"
Lady Macbeth,5,1,2102,buried; he cannot come out on ’s grave.
Doctor,5,1,2103,Even so?
Lady Macbeth,5,1,2104,"To bed, to bed. There’s knocking at the"
Lady Macbeth,5,1,2105,"gate. Come, come, come, come. Give me your"
Lady Macbeth,5,1,2106,"hand. What’s done cannot be undone. To bed, to"
Lady Macbeth,5,1,2107,"bed, to bed."
Doctor,5,1,2108,Will she go now to bed?
Gentlewoman,5,1,2109,Directly.
Doctor,5,1,2110,Foul whisp’rings are abroad. Unnatural deeds
Doctor,5,1,2111,Do breed unnatural troubles. Infected minds
Doctor,5,1,2112,To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.
Doctor,5,1,2113,More needs she the divine than the physician.
Doctor,5,1,2114,"God, God forgive us all. Look after her."
Doctor,5,1,2115,Remove from her the means of all annoyance
Doctor,5,1,2116,"And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night."
Doctor,5,1,2117,"My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight."
Doctor,5,1,2118,I think but dare not speak.
Gentlewoman,5,1,2119,"Good night, good doctor."
Menteith,5,2,2120,"The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,"
Menteith,5,2,2121,"His uncle Siward, and the good Macduff."
Menteith,5,2,2122,"Revenges burn in them, for their dear causes"
Menteith,5,2,2123,Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
Menteith,5,2,2124,Excite the mortified man.
Angus,5,2,2125,Near Birnam Wood
Angus,5,2,2126,Shall we well meet them. That way are they coming.
Caithness,5,2,2127,Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?
Lennox,5,2,2128,"For certain, sir, he is not. I have a file"
Lennox,5,2,2129,Of all the gentry. There is Siward’s son
Lennox,5,2,2130,And many unrough youths that even now
Lennox,5,2,2131,Protest their first of manhood.
Menteith,5,2,2132,What does the tyrant?
Caithness,5,2,2133,Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.
Caithness,5,2,2134,Some say he’s mad; others that lesser hate him
Caithness,5,2,2135,Do call it valiant fury. But for certain
Caithness,5,2,2136,He cannot buckle his distempered cause
Caithness,5,2,2137,Within the belt of rule.
Angus,5,2,2138,Now does he feel
Angus,5,2,2139,His secret murders sticking on his hands.
Angus,5,2,2140,Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach.
Angus,5,2,2141,"Those he commands move only in command,"
Angus,5,2,2142,Nothing in love. Now does he feel his title
Angus,5,2,2143,"Hang loose about him, like a giant’s robe"
Angus,5,2,2144,Upon a dwarfish thief.
Menteith,5,2,2145,"Who, then, shall blame"
Menteith,5,2,2146,His pestered senses to recoil and start
Menteith,5,2,2147,When all that is within him does condemn
Menteith,5,2,2148,Itself for being there?
Caithness,5,2,2149,"Well, march we on"
Caithness,5,2,2150,To give obedience where ’tis truly owed.
Caithness,5,2,2151,"Meet we the med’cine of the sickly weal,"
Caithness,5,2,2152,And with him pour we in our country’s purge
Caithness,5,2,2153,Each drop of us.
Lennox,5,2,2154,Or so much as it needs
Lennox,5,2,2155,To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.
Lennox,5,2,2156,Make we our march towards Birnam.
Macbeth,5,3,2157,Bring me no more reports. Let them fly all.
Macbeth,5,3,2158,Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane
Macbeth,5,3,2159,I cannot taint with fear. What’s the boy Malcolm?
Macbeth,5,3,2160,Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know
Macbeth,5,3,2161,All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:
Macbeth,5,3,2162,"Fear not, Macbeth. No man that’s born of woman"
Macbeth,5,3,2163,"Shall e’er have power upon thee. Then fly, false"
Macbeth,5,3,2164,"thanes,"
Macbeth,5,3,2165,And mingle with the English epicures.
Macbeth,5,3,2166,The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
Macbeth,5,3,2167,Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.
Macbeth,5,3,2168,"The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!"
Macbeth,5,3,2169,Where got’st thou that goose-look?
Servant,5,3,2170,There is ten thousand—
Macbeth,5,3,2171,"Geese, villain?"
Servant,5,3,2172,"Soldiers, sir."
Macbeth,5,3,2173,"Go prick thy face and over-red thy fear,"
Macbeth,5,3,2174,"Thou lily-livered boy. What soldiers, patch?"
Macbeth,5,3,2175,Death of thy soul! Those linen cheeks of thine
Macbeth,5,3,2176,"Are counselors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?"
Servant,5,3,2177,"The English force, so please you."
Macbeth,5,3,2178,Take thy face hence.
Macbeth,5,3,2179,Seyton!—I am sick at heart
Macbeth,5,3,2180,"When I behold—Seyton, I say!—This push"
Macbeth,5,3,2181,Will cheer me ever or disseat me now.
Macbeth,5,3,2182,I have lived long enough. My way of life
Macbeth,5,3,2183,"Is fall’n into the sere, the yellow leaf,"
Macbeth,5,3,2184,"And that which should accompany old age,"
Macbeth,5,3,2185,"As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,"
Macbeth,5,3,2186,"I must not look to have, but in their stead"
Macbeth,5,3,2187,"Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honor, breath"
Macbeth,5,3,2188,Which the poor heart would fain deny and dare
Macbeth,5,3,2189,not.—
Macbeth,5,3,2190,Seyton!
Seyton,5,3,2191,What’s your gracious pleasure?
Macbeth,5,3,2192,What news more?
Seyton,5,3,2193,"All is confirmed, my lord, which was reported."
Macbeth,5,3,2194,I’ll fight till from my bones my flesh be hacked.
Macbeth,5,3,2195,Give me my armor.
Seyton,5,3,2196,’Tis not needed yet.
Macbeth,5,3,2197,I’ll put it on.
Macbeth,5,3,2198,Send out more horses. Skirr the country round.
Macbeth,5,3,2199,Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine
Macbeth,5,3,2200,armor.—
Macbeth,5,3,2201,"How does your patient, doctor?"
Doctor,5,3,2202,"Not so sick, my lord,"
Doctor,5,3,2203,As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies
Doctor,5,3,2204,That keep her from her rest.
Macbeth,5,3,2205,Cure her of that.
Macbeth,5,3,2206,"Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,"
Macbeth,5,3,2207,"Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,"
Macbeth,5,3,2208,"Raze out the written troubles of the brain,"
Macbeth,5,3,2209,And with some sweet oblivious antidote
Macbeth,5,3,2210,Cleanse the stuffed bosom of that perilous stuff
Macbeth,5,3,2211,Which weighs upon the heart?
Doctor,5,3,2212,Therein the patient
Doctor,5,3,2213,Must minister to himself.
Macbeth,5,3,2214,Throw physic to the dogs. I’ll none of it.—
Macbeth,5,3,2215,"Come, put mine armor on. Give me my staff."
Macbeth,5,3,2216,"Seyton, send out.—Doctor, the thanes fly from"
Macbeth,5,3,2217,me.—
Macbeth,5,3,2218,"Come, sir, dispatch.—If thou couldst, doctor, cast"
Macbeth,5,3,2219,"The water of my land, find her disease,"
Macbeth,5,3,2220,"And purge it to a sound and pristine health,"
Macbeth,5,3,2221,I would applaud thee to the very echo
Macbeth,5,3,2222,"That should applaud again.—Pull ’t off, I say.—"
Macbeth,5,3,2223,"What rhubarb, senna, or what purgative drug"
Macbeth,5,3,2224,Would scour these English hence? Hear’st thou of
Macbeth,5,3,2225,them?
Doctor,5,3,2226,"Ay, my good lord. Your royal preparation"
Doctor,5,3,2227,Makes us hear something.
Macbeth,5,3,2228,Bring it after me.—
Macbeth,5,3,2229,I will not be afraid of death and bane
Macbeth,5,3,2230,Till Birnam Forest come to Dunsinane.
Doctor,5,3,2231,"Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,"
Doctor,5,3,2232,Profit again should hardly draw me here.
Malcolm,5,4,2233,"Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand"
Malcolm,5,4,2234,That chambers will be safe.
Menteith,5,4,2235,We doubt it nothing.
Siward,5,4,2236,What wood is this before us?
Menteith,5,4,2237,The Wood of Birnam.
Malcolm,5,4,2238,Let every soldier hew him down a bough
Malcolm,5,4,2239,And bear ’t before him. Thereby shall we shadow
Malcolm,5,4,2240,The numbers of our host and make discovery
Malcolm,5,4,2241,Err in report of us.
Soldier(s),5,4,2242,It shall be done.
Siward,5,4,2243,We learn no other but the confident tyrant
Siward,5,4,2244,Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure
Siward,5,4,2245,Our setting down before ’t.
Malcolm,5,4,2246,’Tis his main hope;
Malcolm,5,4,2247,"For, where there is advantage to be given,"
Malcolm,5,4,2248,"Both more and less have given him the revolt,"
Malcolm,5,4,2249,And none serve with him but constrainèd things
Malcolm,5,4,2250,Whose hearts are absent too.
Macduff,5,4,2251,Let our just censures
Macduff,5,4,2252,"Attend the true event, and put we on"
Macduff,5,4,2253,Industrious soldiership.
Siward,5,4,2254,The time approaches
Siward,5,4,2255,That will with due decision make us know
Siward,5,4,2256,What we shall say we have and what we owe.
Siward,5,4,2257,"Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,"
Siward,5,4,2258,But certain issue strokes must arbitrate;
Siward,5,4,2259,"Towards which, advance the war."
Macbeth,5,5,2260,Hang out our banners on the outward walls.
Macbeth,5,5,2261,The cry is still They come! Our castle’s strength
Macbeth,5,5,2262,Will laugh a siege to scorn. Here let them lie
Macbeth,5,5,2263,Till famine and the ague eat them up.
Macbeth,5,5,2264,Were they not forced with those that should be
Macbeth,5,5,2265,"ours,"
Macbeth,5,5,2266,"We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,"
Macbeth,5,5,2267,And beat them backward home.
Macbeth,5,5,2268,What is that noise?
Seyton,5,5,2269,"It is the cry of women, my good lord."
Macbeth,5,5,2270,I have almost forgot the taste of fears.
Macbeth,5,5,2271,The time has been my senses would have cooled
Macbeth,5,5,2272,"To hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hair"
Macbeth,5,5,2273,Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
Macbeth,5,5,2274,As life were in ’t. I have supped full with horrors.
Macbeth,5,5,2275,"Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,"
Macbeth,5,5,2276,Cannot once start me.
Macbeth,5,5,2277,Wherefore was that cry?
Seyton,5,5,2278,"The Queen, my lord, is dead."
Macbeth,5,5,2279,She should have died hereafter.
Macbeth,5,5,2280,There would have been a time for such a word.
Macbeth,5,5,2281,Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Macbeth,5,5,2282,Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
Macbeth,5,5,2283,"To the last syllable of recorded time,"
Macbeth,5,5,2284,And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
Macbeth,5,5,2285,"The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!"
Macbeth,5,5,2286,"Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player"
Macbeth,5,5,2287,That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
Macbeth,5,5,2288,And then is heard no more. It is a tale
Macbeth,5,5,2289,"Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,"
Macbeth,5,5,2290,Signifying nothing.
Macbeth,5,5,2291,Thou com’st to use thy tongue: thy story quickly.
Messenger,5,5,2292,"Gracious my lord,"
Messenger,5,5,2293,"I should report that which I say I saw,"
Messenger,5,5,2294,But know not how to do ’t.
Macbeth,5,5,2295,"Well, say, sir."
Messenger,5,5,2296,"As I did stand my watch upon the hill,"
Messenger,5,5,2297,"I looked toward Birnam, and anon methought"
Messenger,5,5,2298,The Wood began to move.
Macbeth,5,5,2299,Liar and slave!
Messenger,5,5,2300,Let me endure your wrath if ’t be not so.
Messenger,5,5,2301,Within this three mile may you see it coming.
Messenger,5,5,2302,"I say, a moving grove."
Macbeth,5,5,2303,"If thou speak’st false,"
Macbeth,5,5,2304,Upon the next tree shall thou hang alive
Macbeth,5,5,2305,"Till famine cling thee. If thy speech be sooth,"
Macbeth,5,5,2306,I care not if thou dost for me as much.—
Macbeth,5,5,2307,I pull in resolution and begin
Macbeth,5,5,2308,"To doubt th’ equivocation of the fiend,"
Macbeth,5,5,2309,That lies like truth. Fear not till Birnam Wood
Macbeth,5,5,2310,"Do come to Dunsinane, and now a wood"
Macbeth,5,5,2311,"Comes toward Dunsinane.—Arm, arm, and out!—"
Macbeth,5,5,2312,"If this which he avouches does appear,"
Macbeth,5,5,2313,There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.
Macbeth,5,5,2314,I ’gin to be aweary of the sun
Macbeth,5,5,2315,And wish th’ estate o’ th’ world were now
Macbeth,5,5,2316,undone.—
Macbeth,5,5,2317,"Ring the alarum bell!—Blow wind, come wrack,"
Macbeth,5,5,2318,At least we’ll die with harness on our back.
Malcolm,5,6,2319,Now near enough. Your leafy screens throw down
Malcolm,5,6,2320,"And show like those you are.—You, worthy uncle,"
Malcolm,5,6,2321,"Shall with my cousin, your right noble son,"
Malcolm,5,6,2322,Lead our first battle. Worthy Macduff and we
Malcolm,5,6,2323,"Shall take upon ’s what else remains to do,"
Malcolm,5,6,2324,According to our order.
Siward,5,6,2325,Fare you well.
Siward,5,6,2326,"Do we but find the tyrant’s power tonight,"
Siward,5,6,2327,Let us be beaten if we cannot fight.
Macduff,5,6,2328,"Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,"
Macduff,5,6,2329,Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.
Macbeth,5,7,2330,"They have tied me to a stake. I cannot fly,"
Macbeth,5,7,2331,"But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What’s he"
Macbeth,5,7,2332,That was not born of woman? Such a one
Macbeth,5,7,2333,"Am I to fear, or none."
Young Siward,5,7,2334,What is thy name?
Macbeth,5,7,2335,Thou ’lt be afraid to hear it.
Young Siward,5,7,2336,"No, though thou call’st thyself a hotter name"
Young Siward,5,7,2337,Than any is in hell.
Macbeth,5,7,2338,My name’s Macbeth.
Young Siward,5,7,2339,The devil himself could not pronounce a title
Young Siward,5,7,2340,More hateful to mine ear.
Macbeth,5,7,2341,"No, nor more fearful."
Young Siward,5,7,2342,"Thou liest, abhorrèd tyrant. With my sword"
Young Siward,5,7,2343,I’ll prove the lie thou speak’st.
Macbeth,5,7,2344,Thou wast born of
Macbeth,5,7,2345,woman.
Macbeth,5,7,2346,"But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,"
Macbeth,5,7,2347,Brandished by man that’s of a woman born.
Macduff,5,7,2348,"That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!"
Macduff,5,7,2349,"If thou beest slain, and with no stroke of mine,"
Macduff,5,7,2350,My wife and children’s ghosts will haunt me still.
Macduff,5,7,2351,"I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms"
Macduff,5,7,2352,"Are hired to bear their staves. Either thou, Macbeth,"
Macduff,5,7,2353,Or else my sword with an unbattered edge
Macduff,5,7,2354,I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;
Macduff,5,7,2355,"By this great clatter, one of greatest note"
Macduff,5,7,2356,"Seems bruited. Let me find him, Fortune,"
Macduff,5,7,2357,And more I beg not.
Siward,5,7,2358,"This way, my lord. The castle’s gently rendered."
Siward,5,7,2359,"The tyrant’s people on both sides do fight,"
Siward,5,7,2360,"The noble thanes do bravely in the war,"
Siward,5,7,2361,"The day almost itself professes yours,"
Siward,5,7,2362,And little is to do.
Malcolm,5,7,2363,We have met with foes
Malcolm,5,7,2364,That strike beside us.
Siward,5,7,2365,"Enter, sir, the castle."
Macbeth,5,8,2366,Why should I play the Roman fool and die
Macbeth,5,8,2367,"On mine own sword? Whiles I see lives, the gashes"
Macbeth,5,8,2368,Do better upon them.
Macduff,5,8,2369,"Turn, hellhound, turn!"
Macbeth,5,8,2370,Of all men else I have avoided thee.
Macbeth,5,8,2371,But get thee back. My soul is too much charged
Macbeth,5,8,2372,With blood of thine already.
Macduff,5,8,2373,I have no words;
Macduff,5,8,2374,"My voice is in my sword, thou bloodier villain"
Macduff,5,8,2375,Than terms can give thee out.
Macbeth,5,8,2376,Thou losest labor.
Macbeth,5,8,2377,As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
Macbeth,5,8,2378,With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed.
Macbeth,5,8,2379,Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
Macbeth,5,8,2380,"I bear a charmèd life, which must not yield"
Macbeth,5,8,2381,To one of woman born.
Macduff,5,8,2382,"Despair thy charm,"
Macduff,5,8,2383,And let the angel whom thou still hast served
Macduff,5,8,2384,Tell thee Macduff was from his mother’s womb
Macduff,5,8,2385,Untimely ripped.
Macbeth,5,8,2386,"Accursèd be that tongue that tells me so,"
Macbeth,5,8,2387,For it hath cowed my better part of man!
Macbeth,5,8,2388,And be these juggling fiends no more believed
Macbeth,5,8,2389,"That palter with us in a double sense,"
Macbeth,5,8,2390,That keep the word of promise to our ear
Macbeth,5,8,2391,And break it to our hope. I’ll not fight with thee.
Macduff,5,8,2392,"Then yield thee, coward,"
Macduff,5,8,2393,And live to be the show and gaze o’ th’ time.
Macduff,5,8,2394,"We’ll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,"
Macduff,5,8,2395,"Painted upon a pole, and underwrit"
Macduff,5,8,2396,Here may you see the tyrant.
Macbeth,5,8,2397,I will not yield
Macbeth,5,8,2398,To kiss the ground before young Malcolm’s feet
Macbeth,5,8,2399,And to be baited with the rabble’s curse.
Macbeth,5,8,2400,Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane
Macbeth,5,8,2401,"And thou opposed, being of no woman born,"
Macbeth,5,8,2402,Yet I will try the last. Before my body
Macbeth,5,8,2403,"I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,"
Macbeth,5,8,2404,And damned be him that first cries Hold! Enough!
Malcolm,5,8,2405,I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.
Siward,5,8,2406,Some must go off; and yet by these I see
Siward,5,8,2407,So great a day as this is cheaply bought.
Malcolm,5,8,2408,"Macduff is missing, and your noble son."
Ross,5,8,2409,"Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier’s debt."
Ross,5,8,2410,"He only lived but till he was a man,"
Ross,5,8,2411,The which no sooner had his prowess confirmed
Ross,5,8,2412,"In the unshrinking station where he fought,"
Ross,5,8,2413,But like a man he died.
Siward,5,8,2414,Then he is dead?
Ross,5,8,2415,"Ay, and brought off the field. Your cause of sorrow"
Ross,5,8,2416,"Must not be measured by his worth, for then"
Ross,5,8,2417,It hath no end.
Siward,5,8,2418,Had he his hurts before?
Ross,5,8,2419,"Ay, on the front."
Siward,5,8,2420,"Why then, God’s soldier be he!"
Siward,5,8,2421,"Had I as many sons as I have hairs,"
Siward,5,8,2422,I would not wish them to a fairer death;
Siward,5,8,2423,And so his knell is knolled.
Malcolm,5,8,2424,"He’s worth more sorrow, and that I’ll spend for"
Malcolm,5,8,2425,him.
Siward,5,8,2426,He’s worth no more.
Siward,5,8,2427,"They say he parted well and paid his score,"
Siward,5,8,2428,"And so, God be with him. Here comes newer"
Siward,5,8,2429,comfort.
Macduff,5,8,2430,"Hail, King! for so thou art. Behold where stands"
Macduff,5,8,2431,Th’ usurper’s cursèd head. The time is free.
Macduff,5,8,2432,"I see thee compassed with thy kingdom’s pearl,"
Macduff,5,8,2433,"That speak my salutation in their minds,"
Macduff,5,8,2434,Whose voices I desire aloud with mine.
Macduff,5,8,2435,"Hail, King of Scotland!"
Macduff,5,8,2436,"Hail, King of Scotland!"
Malcolm,5,8,2437,We shall not spend a large expense of time
Malcolm,5,8,2438,Before we reckon with your several loves
Malcolm,5,8,2439,And make us even with you. My thanes and
Malcolm,5,8,2440,"kinsmen,"
Malcolm,5,8,2441,"Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland"
Malcolm,5,8,2442,"In such an honor named. What’s more to do,"
Malcolm,5,8,2443,"Which would be planted newly with the time,"
Malcolm,5,8,2444,As calling home our exiled friends abroad
Malcolm,5,8,2445,"That fled the snares of watchful tyranny,"
Malcolm,5,8,2446,Producing forth the cruel ministers
Malcolm,5,8,2447,Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen
Malcolm,5,8,2448,"(Who, as ’tis thought, by self and violent hands,"
Malcolm,5,8,2449,"Took off her life)—this, and what needful else"
Malcolm,5,8,2450,"That calls upon us, by the grace of grace,"
Malcolm,5,8,2451,"We will perform in measure, time, and place."
Malcolm,5,8,2452,"So thanks to all at once and to each one,"
Malcolm,5,8,2453,Whom we invite to see us crowned at Scone.
